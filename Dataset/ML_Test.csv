Dublin is my favourite city out of all the cities i've lived in. there's always an interesting place to go here. the air is incredibly clean here compared to back home and i love taking walks along the grand canal in the evenings. i love riding the bus home after a night out to see all the street lights, pubs, cars and people walking home. i like how walkable the whole city is, and trust me, the buses here are actually pretty reliable compared to the ones in my hometown. i love how multicultural the place is and how easy it is to get food from every sort of cuisine you can imagine (nothing beats the spicy chicken fillet roll though)

i like that i can actually be myself as a queer person and meet other queer people and see pride flags everywhere when i walk out of the streets compared to back home where any sort of rainbow looking thing on my body would cause me to get beaten up immediately. ever since i've arrived here i've truly been opening up as a person and making friends in college and meeting my online friends who live here and i don't think i've ever been happier to be fair

the housing crisis is a catastrophe, it really is. it's a massive failure in all ways and it's frustrating seeing the govt doing nothing but lining the landlords pockets but when i find myself doomscrolling housing posts on here i always remind myself of how grateful i am to be here in the first place and to have a decent room to myself. i will keep my head up and hope for the best in the future

Dublin, like any other city, has its fair share of issues and i don't think its unreasonable to want change.

I’m finally moving down to cork city after 3 months of looking. Now while that nightmare is over I have a new nightmare. I’m leaving all my mates and such in Wicklow/Dublin behind and while I can pop up now and then I really would rather make new friends to have with me since I’m gonna be living In the city for Atleast 2-3 years. 

Problem is I have no idea what people do nowadays to make friends? All my friends have been through education up until now. I have my team in work but I’m 22 and everyone else is older with families. I’ve never been to a bar by myself (I’d like to try but would need some power anti anxieties I think) and the thought of it makes me wanna hide inside I don’t even know how you would start conversations with people. 

I don’t have much hobbies besides the gym and mountain biking (which I have to give up now since no car and I’ll live in the city center) I guess I like games but nowadays it’s more of a passive interest as stuff to do with friends than when I was younger. Also I like rugby but not good enough to play anymore and only like watching the Ireland team. I also have a surfboard I can’t use but would like to learn (kinda fecked without a car again though) 

Basically I’m asking other people that were in a similar situation what they did? Any apps goin? I was thinking about maybe there would be meetups for travelers or foreigners moving down that I could tag into but I think COVID might’ve messed up that scene.

I have been offered a place to study at UCC for the coming academic year (Sociology MA program) and it is among the finalists for me, plus I have a decision deadline of the 21st. I have a few questions about my potential new home, some relating to the city, others relating to the university (since the UCC subreddit is dead.)

Firstly, where do the students and younger people tend to live? Any areas of the city I should focus on or websites I should join to find flatmates? I'd prefer to be near-ish to the university (like sub-30 minute walk) if possible, unless theres some fantastic transit accessibility where I'd end up saving a considerable chunk of change.

Secondly, what is the general cost of living? I've only briefly looked at accommodations so far, but what about food, transit, going out (if things have reopened), etc?

Third, how easy would it be for me as a foreign student to get a part time job? I'm tempted to just not work for the year and save what I can now and just live off that, but I've also been a bartender for nearly three years now and I wouldn't be opposed to doing that or something else part time to help with costs. Obviously this has changed with COVID, but I will be fully vaccinated well before I'm over there if that changes anything.

Fourth, assuming at least some things are re-opened on campus, what is student life like on campus generally? Are the services they offer helpful, what events do they put on, how are the buildings, how is the athletic center, stuff like that.

I’m in Galway, NY, USA. A tiny town of 3600 people in a rural area of New York State, USA. Local lore says it was founded by Scotts as Galloway but a county clerk error named it Galway. Our predominant local ethnicity is Ukrainian or Belarusian, so go figure.

We call it Galway, harder A like Galloway without the o. Seems like the proper Irish pronunciation is more like “Gaullway”?  Locally people get defensive when our town is mentioned with the long A. “Gal” vs “Gaull”. 

Regardless, it’s nice to meet you all, I hope to visit the OG Galway someday and learn more. I’m 100% sure you have better pubs and restaurants than we do. ",Galway to Galway?,1717054132,"Just curious, this sub showed up as suggested. Thanks new

The failure of the government 
The government failed us, simple as. Will they be out of power? NO because they’ve got us fighting each other fighting each other and they want it, do you not think arguing about immigrants is what they want, when we go on a witch hunt pointing fingers at the single mother they get away.

It has to be paid in 21 days the amount 103.90 euro if I don't pay it will be an offence and I may be called to court to pay 1000 euro.

Seriously, what the hell is that? I always use leap card, it charges 4 euro and then when I exit and tag off it adds 2 euro. Sometimes it fails to add 2 euro so I overpay for the trip. Also how am I responsible for their failing scanner and they have free entrance. I was stupid enough to provide my real name and address. I wrote an email to them but have not heard back after 2 weeks so probably they don't reply on purpose. I hate Irish government - medical system is broken, housing crisis is insane, junkies flooding the city center and now asylum seekers. What have I done to deserve this.

Long story short; I stand a very good chance at getting transferred to one of my companies locations near the airport.   
I'm American, but I've visit Dublin numerous times.  I would be moving with my wife and 2 children.  My company will assist with housing, so I am not looking for advice on that.   


The reason for this post; I keep hearing pretty conflicting information about safety from people I know and of course the internet.  
I have two cousins that live in Dublin (both in their 20's, no children, living that young life - so not exactly the perspective of safety I am hoping to find) one in Finglas the other in Rathmines.  Rathmines seemed fine, while Finglas to me just seemed a little rough around the edges, but not particularly dangerous.  The cousin in Rathmines says Dublin is going to shit - packs of youngsters in track suits roaming attacking everyone and the one in Finglas said Dublin, overall, is improving rapidly and we shouldn't have anything to worry about if we aren't looking for trouble.  I didn't see any packs of youngsters roaming looking for trouble any time I had been there (both north and south side) nor any neighborhoods I felt I should exit sooner rather than later.   


For context we are moving from the Bay Area, California (San Jose to be specific). Which seems similar to Dublin in a few aspects; both around 1.8 mil in population, small downtown with spread out suburbs etc.   


What's your guys take on safety, especially in context to a family living here?  If anyone has spent any time in the San Jose area, or Bay Area in general and can give any sort of comparison that would be ideal!   


I'll be completely honest; this post is more to calm my wife's nerves.  I am not worried at all, but I would love to show her other people confirming or giving their input on moving to Dublin and why would be a great choice for our family.   


One more note; I haven't heard anything on this but - do you have any idea how foreign kids are treat at schools there? Some countries have a really bad reputation of bullying foreign kids, but I've never heard this about Dublin. If you have anything to add to this, it would be much appreciated!

I've started looking for accomodation and I would like to find a place that is at a reasonable distance both from Dublin and Leixlip. In particular:

*  I will probably need to work from office 2 or 3 times per week, when the Covid situation will improve (hopefully ...)
* in my free time, I would like to go to Dublin on the weekends and at least 1 - 2 weekdays after work (but I usually don't go out every single day after work)

Moreover the prices seems to be much lower than in Dublin.

I have a sincere question for the Irish community.

Although I'm not Irish, I've been living in Ireland for several years. Despite not being a drinker myself, I've frequented many pubs with friends. Today, something happened that left me puzzled, and I'm seeking your opinions on whether this is considered normal in Ireland.

My parents are visiting me for the first time in Ireland. While my father and I don't drink, my mom wanted to experience some Irish beers in a pub. We stopped by a pub in Clondalkin, ordered a pint for her, and took a seat at a relatively quiet table. Although there were some locals present, it wasn't crowded. I have to mention that I felt quite uncomfortable getting some people staring at us. But didn't bother me enough so I let it go. However, within five minutes of sitting down, the bartender approached us and inquired if we planned to order anything else. I explained that we were still enjoying my mom's first beer. In a rather rude manner, he insisted that my father and I must order something, even suggesting a coffee. When I declined, he abruptly asked us to leave, leaving me shocked and disbelieving. Unfortunately, my parents, who don't speak English, were unaware of the situation.

I questioned the bartender's seriousness, to which he affirmed and rudely instructed us to 'WALK AWAY' and 'GET OUT.' This was a frustrating first experience for my parents in an Irish pub.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Do you think we would have been treated the same way if we weren't foreigners?",3 people in a pub (only 1 drinking allowed?),1700938245,"

In a rather rude manner, he insisted that my father and I must order something, even suggesting a coffee. When I declined, he abruptly asked us to leave, leaving me shocked and disbelieving. Unfortunately, my parents, who don't speak English, were unaware of the situation.

I questioned the bartender's seriousness, to which he affirmed and rudely instructed us to 'WALK AWAY' and 'GET OUT.' This was a frustrating first experience for my parents in an Irish pub.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Do you think we would have been treated the same way if we weren't foreigners?",25-11-2023 18:50,2023,

Then he told us that after 6 months he will extend the lease and knock off €50 each tenant. When we asked him to share us the new lease, which he never shared after multiple requests.

And he always took cash from us for the rent. Said, it’s okay if one person sends it to my account, else I want in cash only.

When the time came, he blatantly declined, then after a long argument, he agreed to it. But after this, he started to try take money from everything possible. He had an old recliner at the house, out of nowhere he decides to replace it with a new one and asks us to pay for the new one and wasn’t backing down. Telling us that since the recliner existed in our tenancy, we are liable for the wear and tear on his sofa leather, which was already there.
Moss started to appear on the wall, he said I will cut your deposit, you clean it or paint the wall. And many more things like this happened.

After seeing all this, we started looking other place, which we found.

We then told him that we will be moving out after this month’s rent. He asks us to bring replacement, fair enough, we found a family which agreed to replace us. 

After telling this to the landlord he became very angry for some reason, calls and starts yelling at us, says we have been very bad to him, we asked why? He said, I won’t keep a family, I will only keep indian students as tenants because they don’t argue and do everything I say.

Says if you want to move out, only 2 out of 4 are allowed to move out, else if everyone wants to leave, I will take remaining 2 months rent and wont even give you the deposit. We agreed about the deposit but I asked that there is no lease, on what basis are you asking 2 months rent?

Listed below are a bunch of halal restaurants I've found around Galway. I thought this list would be of help to anybody who eats halal. I was also wondering if anybody knows any more restaurants?

I recently learned that the restaurant and deli in the Hyde Hotel have halal chicken since they serve a lot of international guests and it made me think there's probably much more places that serve halal meat and could get more business if they just advertised it!

Thank you.

&#x200B;

I am planning to move to Cork, Ireland. I work for a tech company in the Bay Area in California. My boyfriend of 7 years lives in Dublin, working as a chemical engineer. He tried to come here, but nothing really worked. So I am planning to take a leap and move to Cork (I can't move to Dublin since my company has a big office in Cork only, not Dublin).

Some of the things that seem appealing about Cork:

1. I get to live with my boyfriend, start a life and a family together :)
2. I have never worked in Europe, or experienced a good work-life balance.
3. I have visited Ireland twice before. Love the the music, and everything is SO GREEN!! I hiked Glendalough and was in love!
4. I fell in love with the people.
5. Cork seems to have amazing food scene, and I am so looking forward to it.

What I didn't like (and this isn't Cork specific, more Ireland specific)

1. Salary: I make $155,000 base salary here, plus \~60-100k RSUs per year as refreshers. The salary I am being offered in Cork is EURO 65,000, without any stock replenishment. Naturally I am bummed.
2. Drinking culture: I used to be a drinker in my early 20s. I drink like once  a month now due to health reasons
3. The weather. Very difficult to wrap your head around the fact it is barely ever sunny
4. Minor: homes- I am so used to modern homes, with all amenities, but Ireland homes are frankly tiny and dank, it's a big jarring
5. Super Minor: How is Amazon Fresh and Prime next day delivery not a thing yet? Largely, the absence of such basic conveniences of life that I am so used to now.

&#x200B;

To feel a bit better, I spoke with a colleague who moved from Cork, too, and I was further demotivated. He said:

1. I am an Indian passport holder, so I can't really travel to EU or UK randomly, I'll need a visa every time I wish to move anywhere, and it can be a pain. So for me, it won't be as easy to travel (and the prospect of traveling Europe on weekends was a big plus in my head)
2. I am extremely outdoorsy. I love hiking, climbing, tennis. But it seems it's usually really rainy and very rarely will it be a hike-worthy weather in and around Cork

&#x200B;

I have been following this sub and I feel Cork is an amazing city with amazing people. The decision to move has been incredibly hard from just a financial angle , but every day I have doubts.

I don't know what my exact question is lol, but I'd love to hear from you what you think of my situation and if you have any advice.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks to everyone for responding. Couple of points: 

1. I am sorry that this came across arrogant. It is a huge decision for me and so I am just being very blunt about it. I understand this could have hurt feelings and will be mindful going forward.

I used to think he was harmless until a few months ago when he did something that absolutely terrified me. I'd encountered him a few times previously where he'd stopped me in the street and asked me for directions to something but aside from his strange appearance ( ALWAYS wearing the same clothes and the ears...) I didn't find him threatening or overly strange. Until one night I was waiting outside an apartment block off george's quay at about 10 o'clock and he came up to me. Rather than the sort of questions (directions mainly, once stopped my indian friend and asked was she french..) that he had asked me and people I knew, he began questioning me about who I was,where I was from, what age I was, if I had a boyfriend, where I lived etc. etc. I was getting a bit freaked out but thankfully then the buzzer went and the gate to the building began to open. I said I had to go and he stepped in front of me and said he would walk me in to the door of the particular apartment. Getting a little scared I apologized and said it was a private complex, stepped quickly inside and when he went to follow me I forced the gate back on top of him. He then began to scream and try to grab me through the gate. I was absolutely terrified and ran to the apartment without looking back.

264,Dublin,Significant-Sport807,80141,t3_182cwjq,"
I'm reaching out to our community during these turbulent times in Dublin to share some thoughts that I believe are crucial for us to consider.

1. No Winners in Chaos: The current unrest following the tragic knife attack in our city serves no one - not the Irish, not the migrants, nor our economy and businesses. It's a downward spiral affecting us all.

2. The Real Victims: Undoubtedly, the victims of the knife assault didn't deserve this horror. Our hearts go out to them and their families. However, let's be clear: the ongoing riots are an entirely different matter, disconnected from the initial tragedy.

3. Criminality Has No Nationality: Just because the alleged attacker was an immigrant doesn't criminalize all immigrants. Similarly, an Irish criminal doesn't represent the entire nation. This fact seems conveniently ignored by ultra-right factions.

4. Mob Mentality: The current wave of riots resembles the reckless behavior of those who brazenly steal motorcycles in broad daylight in Dublin. Strangely, we don't see protests against that. It's a herd mentality, feeling invincible and unaccountable.

5. A Legal Quandary: The authorities face a tough challenge in curbing these riots, especially due to laws protecting minors, who now seem to have a shield against any forceful intervention, even by law enforcement. It's a trap of our own making.

6. Self-Destruction:The arsons, mall raids, Luas vandalism, and burning cars hurt Irish citizens, not migrants. It's ironically extremism against one's own nation, masked by so-called patriotic slogans.

7. A Vicious Cycle on Social Media: Alarmingly, there are emerging groups on social media inciting further violence, even calling for attacks on migrants. If this leads to more harm, it'll only perpetuate a cycle of hatred that's hard to break. Imagine if today's incensed mob attacks a migrant family with children. Tomorrow, we might see retaliation from radical migrants. It only gets worse.

8. A Plea for Peace: If you know someone involved or planning to join these riots, please stop them. Share this message. We must unite now to prevent further escalation and avoid turning our beloved country into a battleground, like so many others across the globe.

Peace to all.",A Call for Sanity Amidst the Chaos in Dublin,1700779156,"
I'm reaching out to our community during these turbulent times in Dublin to share some thoughts that I believe are crucial for us to consider.

1. No Winners in Chaos: The current unrest following the tragic knife attack in our city serves no one - not the Irish, not the migrants, nor our economy and businesses. It's a downward spiral affecting us all.

2. The Real Victims: Undoubtedly, the victims of the knife assault didn't deserve this horror. Our hearts go out to them and their families. However, let's be clear: the ongoing riots are an entirely different matter, disconnected from the initial tragedy.

3. Criminality Has No Nationality: Just because the alleged attacker was an immigrant doesn't criminalize all immigrants. Similarly, an Irish criminal doesn't represent the entire nation. This fact seems conveniently ignored by ultra-right factions.

4. Mob Mentality: The current wave of riots resembles the reckless behavior of those who brazenly steal motorcycles in broad daylight in Dublin. Strangely, we don't see protests against that. It's a herd mentality, feeling invincible and unaccountable.

5. A Legal Quandary: The authorities face a tough challenge in curbing these riots, especially due to laws protecting minors, who now seem to have a shield against any forceful intervention, even by law enforcement. It's a trap of our own making.

6. Self-Destruction:The arsons, mall raids, Luas vandalism, and burning cars hurt Irish citizens, not migrants. It's ironically extremism against one's own nation, masked by so-called patriotic slogans.

7. A Vicious Cycle on Social Media: Alarmingly, there are emerging groups on social media inciting further violence, even calling for attacks on migrants. If this leads to more harm, it'll only perpetuate a cycle of hatred that's hard to break. Imagine if today's incensed mob attacks a migrant family with children. Tomorrow, we might see retaliation from radical migrants. It only gets worse.

266,Dublin,Puzzled_Oil6016,53849,t3_oggoqk,"I usually don’t write political stuff on Reddit because it results in bans if you don’t 100 % support neo libtardism or communism. Especially on the Irish subs.

But I was struck by a comment about the housing crisis so thought I’d a private message to the commenter who posted his fears on the Ireland sub but I changed my mind and thought I’d post it here instead and share the truth with all of you.

Hi, can’t respond on the ireland sub as I got banned by the commies who moderate it. Remember that equality under communism means nobody owns anything except those in charge..today it’s called “Neo Feudalism”

Just so you know Simon Coveney is on the record for saying the plan is to turn Ireland into a “nation of renters”. How’s that for an oxymoron. I used to have the clip of him saying it but unsurprisingly it’s vanished from YouTube. 

People need to fully understand that all of this is orchestrated and has been for a long time. This is how the banks destroy the nation state in order to have their lovely globalist utopia.

The embarrassment who currently “leads” this county made the following statement 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=akkPu-FJyiA

Now to me it’s unimaginable that this guy is really in charge of things because he’s effectively and proudly telling us all, he’s not in charge. The EU and UN are.

The same thing is going on in every western country. They broke the link between home ownership and the people and they broke the link between elected governments and democracy. So it doesn’t matter who you vote for, it’s always the same shit sandwich. If you don’t own a home or land you really are dispossessed of your own country because as you know a landlord can turf you out at will with the excuse of selling or doing the house up..it’s been done to me twice in Dublin in the last 7 years and the PRTB are toothless and designed to be toothless just like the useless housing charities here that exist to take donations and do nothing else. 

As you can imagine the stress has been intolerable at times and God knows how many people have offed themselves over this shit.

 All landlords need say is they changed their plans and by that time you’re already gone and under a new lease so can’t move back anyhow..PRTB know this as I explained it loud and clear to them ages ago. So the government know full well and are enabling this shit the vulture funds etc  are just another example of how all of this is 100% deliberately being done. So no point voting because voting won’t change what’s being done deliberately by entities who control all the politics in this and every western country. 

The yellow vests in France had over a year of weekly protests and that didn’t change shit either. At least they tried though.

Bottom line is the Irish government has no intention of fixing the housing crisis, duh, because they created it on purpose and the EU with all their gay pride and meaningless “equality” Only means they want you to be hoodwinked and distracted with race and sexuality but are working overtime to ensure real substantial meaningful inequality grows exponentially. Will we see the Irish footy team protest on behalf of people trapped in the homelessness crisis? No..because they are too busy kneeling for the MSM and bankers narratives. For shit that has nothing to even do with Ireland. 

 They want the ordinary people to have 0. Just be a gig eCONomy wage slave for the rest of their life’s. Which disincentives people from starting families because of the insecurity with rents plus knowing you will never have an asset and security to pass on to children. And that is absolutely another reason why this has been orchestrated, to lower the birthdate and then use it as an excuse for more immigration which again helps break the link with the people and their country. Sorry if I’m coming off as “right wing” but there is no alternative in this county. All parties are globalist and the so called alternatives are just more extreme examples of the same shite. 

The Irish of all people should understand what this is because it has all happened before when we were tenants in our own land and kicked off it. 

But alas if its not the “Brits” doing it, not only does nobody notice but many cheer it on in the name of “progressiveness”. In fact I’d wager it’s more important to most of the Irish, that England lose the Euro final that the housing crisis get fixed. I kid you not, at the state of Ireland and the bread and circuses.

The housing, healthcare and childcare situation here in Canada BC is really bad, for example we didn't manage to secure a family doctor after moving cities, our daughter hence can't get her yearly checkup and if something minor were to happen we'd have to sit in the ER for many many hours to receive care. We also signed her up for full-time daycare 3 months after she was born and nothing ever came of it, other than a follow up if we still wanted to remain on the waitlist, which was about 8 month ago by which time I've already had to make the decision to stay home.

But now I'm reading that Ireland isn't doing well either. How bad is it? Would we still be able to secure a family GP? Would we be able to get a spot for her in a creche / childcare?

Also I’m really f*cking annoyed about how one Irish man gets to live as an immigrant in the US, the country where I was f*cking born in, with no worries because he is not a racial minority, but yet when I move to Ireland, his home country, he starts spewing vitriol about immigrants on social media.

Sorry for the rant, I’m just tired holding all this in, because I don’t want to keep these feelings inside anymore.",24-11-2023 11:29,2023,

So, my first big problem was in obtaining the PPSN, the covid caused a lot of delays and I solved that problem thanks to a guy here that give to me good advice.

Now I have spent these holidays here in Dublin, alone, because returning to Italy during a pandemic didn't seem a smart thing to me. So, I was quite sure that this would be a Christmas without gifts...I was wrong!

Today my Landlord told to me that I have to leave the room within January 28th...just to add a little bit of stress to my life.

Now to be clear, I'm a very tidy, clean, and calm tenant...I spend basically all the day studying.

So, now I have started to send mail to rent offers that fit my budget (poor budget) and I will have to do move all my things to another house.

I love Dublin, but the situation of the rent is really really horrible...I mean, I love what I do, so I can manage the situation and face the total lack of comfort, but the landlords here are really the greediest sons of....

**Sunday Afternoon:** Any sculptures/gardens (good weather - George's Dock and St Stephen's Green) or museums/cafes/pubs (bad weather) I feel like I've missed out on

**Sunday Night**: Fly home at 11 so I figure be at airport from 9ish

If needed I might swap Phoenix Park or Hellfire Club for Trinity College (&amp; Library!)

UPDATE 23/03 17:49 (so precise!) Thanks for all the input! I'm thinking skip Howth or Malahide on the Friday so I'm more secure in Dublin rather than delaying my arrival or heading straight out again. Then I can get my coastal fix by going to Killiney/Dalkney/Dún Laoghaire instead of Mountpelier on Saturday. If I'm still jonesing for something coastal then I can swap out or follow up Phoenix Park on Sunday.",23-03-2023 12:07,2023,

353,Dublin,MikeMoy-,63360,t3_vr6tss,"It is clear to everyone that there is a cost of living crisis in ireland with prices spiraling out of control, even far greater than many other EU countries for some items.

One area where I have noticed a huge increase in cost for irish citizens is property rentals. Dublin Ireland is now the 2nd most expensive place in the entire European Union to rent a 1 bed apartment.

I do not understand why the government have not addressed this issue for irish citizens.

This housing crisis is well documented with the government failing to address it for half a decade.

The government now state that it will take years further before the issue will be fixed.

The high rental prices are due to a shortage of properties available to rent on the market. Letting agents can have hundreds of people applying to rent one single property, they have so many people applying to rent the same properties now that they no longer accept rental applications by phone, all applications are by email only, and the majority of emails are not responded to.

The property shortage has gotten so bad that recently in the Dail it was reported that some landlords were enticing potential renters to bid against each other.

For reference, Daft only has around 800 properties listed as available for rent for the whole of Ireland.

**The government act like there is noting they can currently do and that Irish citizens will just have to pay extortionate rental prices for years until the private sector builds more properties.**

As a temporary measure the government can increase supply to the rental market immediately by using hotel accommodation to house irish citizens.

Back in April it was reported that the government are providing 3,000 hotel rooms to house Ukrainians.

If the government provided 3,000 hotel rooms to house irish citizens it would immediately increase supply to the rental market, reducing demand which would help cool the market and reduce property rental prices within weeks, not years.

I would propose that the irish citizen hotel rooms are part funded by the irish citizens occupying them and the remainder picked up by the state. The rental rates would be set by the state.

The government can clearly afford to do this as they are already spending a greater amount of state funds on accommodating Ukrainians in the hotels, so cost is not an issue.

The government are sitting back while people pay excessive property rental rates, telling people that it will take years to fix until the private sector build more properties.

I have unfortunately seen so many negative comments on post about st.patrick's day, when foreigners ask about tips for St.patrick's day. So if you don't have any nice thing to say, dont say it at all, as it really destroys our exitement. 
We are two very exiting girls from Scandinavia, looking forward to celebrate our 30th birthday in Dublin😎 Everything is booked and ready. we will be in Dublin from 13th to 19th for St.patrick's day and for hiking and sightseeing. So we have quite few days. We will be living in O'Connell street, which is perfect for us. I have been to Dublin before and I couldn't think of a more practical place to stay, as it is so easy to go from one place to another.

I have yet to find a post that answers my questions in detail, but hopefully the members in this group can help, especially if you are a local, or a foreigner with a good experience of St.patrick's day. 

Q1: If you were a local singel girl in your 30s on St.patrick's day, wanting to have a day full of fun and good interaction with good music and atmosphere, which pubs, bars, nightclubs would you go to? I know Temple bar area will be packed, which we actually don't mind, but it would have been nice to find a """"secret place""""  with less people, which perhaps locals would go to (Don't answer if your are one of those who say """" locals stay at home St.patrick's day, it is only for foreigners and just a lot of drunkeness and crowded everywhere😂)

Q2: What spot would you recommend to watch the parade?

Q3: Do you have any other tips and tricks for St.patrick's day, for making it a good experience😁?

Q4: last but not least- Is there a website with information for the festival? Or like a facebook page or something which I can use to keep us updated🤯?

387,Dublin,asleshaa,44724,t3_dn6lq8,"I’ve been in Dublin for over a month now. 
And I’ve lived in different countries before this. But I’ve been at the end of some really weird things in Dublin. 
Although I would like to clearly state that my overall experience has been wonderful. I love talking to Irish people and getting to know them. 
But here are a few incidents that happened with me. 

1) on the bus today, a teenager slipped and fell. He dropped his wallet and a few Euros fell out. I picked them up to give them back to the kid, but he’d stepped off the bus. So, I got off at the next stop and I walked back to find him near the Camden. 
I explained to him that I was on the same bus and that he had dropped some money when he slipped. I  pulled out the money to hand it to him, but he just said, “Sorry, I don’t speak with people like you.” 
And just walked away. 
I found it really weird. I mean his loss, but still. Weird af. 
I gave the money to a homeless dude sitting outside Tesco. 


2) I was in a shop in Merchant’s Quay. I think it was called News and Booze if I remember correctly. I step out after I was done and some random guy just throws a half eaten sandwich at me and runs away. 
I absolutely don’t know why. I had done nothing to provoke him. I do not even know who he was. 

3) Around the start of October, I was walking towards The Grand Canal Dock late in the evening. And a group of teenagers were standing on the corner, just before the Ringsend road bus stop. They had a dog with them. 
As I was walking past them, they decided it would be fun to set the dog on me. He held it back just enough so it wouldn’t bite me. But they did follow me till I reached my friends place  (which wasn’t that far) 

I’m not scared of dogs, but that doesn’t mean I enjoy a dog snapping at my heels. 


I just don’t understand it. There were a few other things, but I mean is it racism? Did I do anything wrong? I accept that I’m not perfect, but in these scenarios, I seriously don’t think I did anything wrong. 

And again, I’ve come across a lot of wonderful people since I arrived in Ireland. People who stepped out of their way to help me out with simple things because I was new to the country. 

But I can’t wrap my head around people throwing food at me and stuff.

Edit: I am Indian by nationality.

Edit 2: I really appreciate everyone who has apologised for my experiences even when it wasn’t you. 
It’s this dichotomy that made me write this post. I mean almost everyone of you is so warm and welcoming. I’ve had servers in diners ask me if I wanted the food a bit more spicy because I was Indian and people who ask me if I need help to get around the city. 
Your spirit truly moves me and makes me fall in love with this city every new day.

I landed a job in Dublin and I'll be relocating there in a week from now, but truth be told, I'm worried/scared AF.

I'm a 27, M, Christian (Protestant) gay Arab from Israel.. (that's one hell of combo right there).
and I feel like I was delt a bad hand (not the worst though).

I'm fed up with whats going on in my home country (even prior to the on-going one-sided war that's taking place)

As an Arab living in this country, and like many/most arabs residing here, we all have an identity issue, our grandparents and great grandparents were born in these lands, prior to becoming of Israel.
Many arabs nowadays refer to themselves as Palestinians, but others, like me, don't, as we were born in the state of Israel, owning an Israeli passport, never truly lived through Palestine to truly acknowledge it, yet are unable to call ourselve Israelis without a pinch of salt, as the county by definition does not represent us, neither in it's flag nor in it's national hymn.. 

I'm also not proud of being an Arab :/
from my experiences, many Arab are:

- Homophobic and follow dated ideologies and traditions, such as """"the name of the family comes first"""" and not wanting to humiliate the family or spread talk, or the fact that some families will throw their kid to the streets for being gay (mainly the ones residing in smaller villages), to name a few.

- Mostly Muslim, (and there's nothing wrong with it), but then again.. how does that represent me as a Christian? 

I'm so fed up with these non-ending inner conflicts (and I didn't mention all of em)... I just want to live my life in peace and without worries or concerns, I want a place I could call home with a sense of pride, but even then, even if I manage to acquire a citizenship elsewhere, will I truly have a sense of belonging? 
I'll be alone in a foreign country, without my family and loved ones surrounding me.. always being an odd duck, never truly fully mastering the language or becoming a native.

Plus not to mention the fact that currently in Ireland (and in most of Europe), many people are fed up with all the immegtants. even if the heat is directed towards illegal migrants or some """"asylum"""" seekers, or towards the government who's not taking proper actions to improve the housing/increasing-crime-rates crisis.
I'm certain it'll also affect me in a way, when wanting to rent a place, or maybe in my social life.

And funny enough, I never visited Ireland before, nor did I live alone more than 3 months (I am capable of independence though, from cooking to cleaning and everything).. and I'm probably gonna have a steep learning curve at work..
Plus I'll have to send some money home to financially support my Ma (as I am the only source of income and the main provider at home due to many circumstances)

If someone has done this movement and is still on this sub, Please do share your views. If you haven’t but knows about this topic, please do chip in, your views are appreciated. 

In my view:

Cons of moving: 
1) US seems to be a “High Stress” and competitive country where everything starting from commute to life at work maybe more challenging than Ireland. There seems to be a overwhelming feeling of “hustling” and not peace. 
2) very long queue for green card / fear of being asked to leave if your name doesn’t come up in H1B visa. 
3) Letting go of great work life balance ( I work for F(M)AANG) 
4) Letting go of welcoming and friendly Irish people. 
5) Letting go of Short commute( I live 2 min from my office ) 
6) overall, Life is very peaceful in Dublin owing to its medium size, accessibility and culture (not valuing wealth and hustle above peace). 

Pros of moving 
1) At least 20% more savings. Cost of living and high rent has become a big headache for us, even though we “thought” we earn well. 
2) More career opportunities to grow.  
3) More opportunities to “even unwillingly” up-level yourself thanks to competition at work, hence future proofing your job prospects. 
4) More Travel opportunities within a large country because of size. 
5) More amenities ( selection of Products and services)  and recreational activities to do.

3. Legalise W33d, do I need to explain this it's a win win for everyone. We can all chill the fuck out and smoke a joint together and not only that, think of the capital it will bring into the country! 

Anyway these are just three of the many things I can think of about the general welfare of everyone. I just hope Ireland pulls through this because from what I can see its going down hill fast.

427,cork,GodDamnNeutral,7253,t3_ot8nmi,"I've always loved urban planning, wandering around foreign cities and seeing small differences between Irish cities and cities in, say, France, Germany or Portugal. But something that always bugs me about Irish cities and more specifically Leeside is that the City and County councils appear to lack either the budget, will or foresight to 'name' our streets.

Okay, first off, I'm talking about street-name signs not just a lack of names for some of our streets (that's another issue I'll get to in a sec!). And though the city centre is well signposted enough, even the immediate suburbs sometimes have a severe lack of signage or it's falling apart. To be fair, the inner city design is quite cool and should be kept [http://visacollector.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ireland\_patrick.jpg](http://visacollector.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ireland_patrick.jpg)

In the city's immediate suburbs, signs are sometimes distinguished with letters 1-4, denoting the older postcode system used internally by An Post. *No one* *ever* referred to anywhere in Cork City as *Cork 2* for example so these signs could be replaced. [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Clanrickarde\_St\_Cork\_2\_sign.jpg/200px-Clanrickarde\_St\_Cork\_2\_sign.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Clanrickarde_St_Cork_2_sign.jpg/200px-Clanrickarde_St_Cork_2_sign.jpg)

You're probably thinking, like what does it really matter, despite being a city Cork is still quite parochial everyone knows their way around etc, but I think the problem is actually a bit deeper than that. I think street name signs actually give you a good sense of place and community.

Driving around Douglas for example you may notice that signs on street corners have been put up about a year or two ago. This is a welcome change, as Douglas is *severely* lacking in character (it's basically a carpark atm). But the addition of new roads and streets that have been built over the years have suffered a worse fate - they're aren't even named. The road that serves the Village Shopping Centre, the link road which connects Jacob's Island to Skehard Road - no names; they're referred to as 'link roads.' They'd be better named after local people.

Here's what I'd love to see: seeing as the City's boundary expanded in 2019 and new districts were enlarged, street name signs are designed based on their Local Electoral Areas. So there's 5 of them (linked below), and their design could based on a use of different colours to distinguish them from other LEAs.

Good idea or bad idea? Interesting initiative or pointless waste of time? I'd be genuinely interested to know what people think.",Streetname signs,1627474372,"I've always loved urban planning, wandering around foreign cities and seeing small differences between Irish cities and cities in, say, France, Germany or Portugal. But something that always bugs me about Irish cities and more specifically Leeside is that the City and County councils appear to lack either the budget, will or foresight to 'name' our streets.

Okay, first off, I'm talking about street-name signs not just a lack of names for some of our streets (that's another issue I'll get to in a sec!). And though the city centre is well signposted enough, even the immediate suburbs sometimes have a severe lack of signage or it's falling apart. To be fair, the inner city design is quite cool and should be kept [http://visacollector.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ireland\_patrick.jpg](http://visacollector.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ireland_patrick.jpg)

In the city's immediate suburbs, signs are sometimes distinguished with letters 1-4, denoting the older postcode system used internally by An Post. *No one* *ever* referred to anywhere in Cork City as *Cork 2* for example so these signs could be replaced.

430,Dublin,taslam,77299,t3_1614jco,"So, in 2021 I got a 48 SIM and started using that as my primary number, and went to one of those second hand phone/phone repair places and picked up a banger for 50 quid to use as a permanent wifi hotspot with my old 3 SIM.

Now, I've always known the phone was dodgy because I started getting missed calls from numbers that were suspiciously similar to contacts of mine, but I never answered and what the hell it just sits there and facilitates my attempt to commit suicide by watching Netflix, so I didn't really care.

This year, I tried to root the phone, but discovered that the recovery has been replaced with a static screen, either flashed or locked, ditto the bootloader. It should have been rootable. Annoying, but what the hell, I was only tinkering for the sake of it and I already had a rooted Xiaomi. 

Today I was trying to piece some history together from call logs. At some point I installed a call log analytics app but never used it - on the rooted Redmi. I use a call log backup tool. I stopped using the old abacus because my rooted Redmi was a preferable backup to have sitting on the table if I want to mess around. The app synced the call logs from the old Nokia 1 to my rooted Redmi.

So there I was perusing the call logs and I went into analytics.

Since I bought that phone, I haven't just been getting missed calls, the phone has been actively dialling and sustaining active calls with myriad numbers including 1890 ones and foreign numbers, and accepting calls from equally dubious numbers, with some calls lasting up to and above an hour at a time, as well as short code numbers. Literally well over 100-200 different numbers, some up to 20 times. Including my phone banking number which I have never ever used. 

So. Maybe I'm being crazy. I've been told I sometimes leap to conclusions without sufficient evidence.

But, guys, I'm starting to suspect that there's something fishy going on with this phone they sold me.

Like, one or two of those things , yeah that's fine. But *all* of those things? Someone has been up to some nefarious shit. 

Anyone have experience buying second hand phones from those (am I being racist saying they seem to be mainly Asian establishments?) Phone shops? Any dodgy stuff like this? Surely they would have securely factory reset before selling them, right? Isn't it much more likely they sold me a ringer (if you'll pardon the wordplay) than it is likely that some criminal mastermind flashed and old Nokia 1 and left some sneaky factory-reset-persistent malware lying in wait to make money off me on the sly? They have to be hip to this, surely? It seems like the kind of scam that works with numerous such compromised devices each slowly draining the credit from their victims long term right? So hary the work of a lone wolf? I mean, you're hardly going to break bad scamming someone who had to buy a second hand Nokia 1 in 2021 when they needed a phone, right?

I’ve been quietly lurking this sub for a month or so while considering accepting a job offer from Apple. It’s an entry level engineer position with a base salary of about €45k. Currently, I’m living in Switzerland with my boyfriend finishing up my masters. I’m not European or Swiss so getting any offer in the first place was a dream but the company being Apple is mind blowing. I am so grateful. 

So, the dilemma. I am a student in Switzerland and I really love it here and I will graduate with a Swiss degree which would allow me a bit of an easier time to find a job here, even with my immigration status. A job here would mean a much higher salary, I wouldn’t have to relocate and start over, I wouldn’t have to go through the pains of a long distance relationship. But I don’t have any offers yet. I do, however, have an offer from Apple, which would really accelerate my career and I could learn so much. 

Another tricky part of this is that I have a big student loan to pay off. I did my bachelor’s degree in the US (also not American) and I have to pay off this debt in 10 years with an interest rate of 7.5%. If I didn’t have this debt, the decision would be significantly easier. With €45k, I imagine I would live pretty well in Cork but I wouldn’t be saving a lot and definitely would not be able to make any significant load payments. 

Do you think working at Apple and moving to Cork is worth the extra couple years of interest to grow my career? Or should I stay in Switzerland and try to find something here?

Although this post is very long I cannot stress enough the importance of reading.

This past Thursday in a bar that will remain nameless due to fears of legal action against me, I was treated in a malicious and humiliating manner.

After finishing work I decided to treat myself to a cold beverage in a Dublin bar, my stomach was rumbling due to missing my lunch break (those darn deadlines!!!)

Upon entering the premises I noticed a wonderful aroma of what I thought was hot dogs... This excited my empty belly to no end. 

I approached the bar and asked the bar keep for a pint of IPA (India pale ale) and inquired if the bar sold hot dogs due to the smell I had noticed. The bar keep simply laughed in my face and said """"no we don't"""".

A bit embarrassed I found a seat and began letting loose on my delicious IPA, while watching funny videos on YouTube.com.

Through the corner of my eye I could see the bar staff pointing and leering at me all laughing together. This embarrassed me something awful.

Not three minutes later I see a member of staff walk over to another table with a plate in hand and place it in front of the handsome young couple... To my horror the plate held two luscious hot dogs.

This made my heart sink and I began getting light headed. Why would they lie to me? I asked myself. What was it about me that made them withhold the hot dogs.

The staff member then whispered something to the gorgeous young couple. The couple and the staff member then looked directly at me and started HOWLING laughing.

What did I do wrong?

Has this ever happened to you?

I need answers please.

(Grades, matura,...). I already know an english test/certificate will be needed, do I need to take one for Irish as well?
What cities are the most student-friendly and what is the general opinion on immigrants there?
Can I join a GAA club there as an immigrant? I tried hurling and football back in April and I really liked both of the sports. 
Thanks for your time.",15-11-2023 21:12,2023,

I had to leave my crossfit gym which I loved since I joined early 2018. The community spirit in the gym and class based workouts capped at 12/14 really suited me.  


I joined a commercial gym - Icon Health Club on Camden St, which allows you access to Dartry Health Club & One Escape Smithfield (off peak upto 4pm & weekends). It's €65 a month which falls between the super fit super busy Flyefits/Ben Dunne's @ €30 a month, and the crazy dear ones beside me @ €150 upwards.  


Not the same at all, struggling to get back into it coming from the class based gyms as last few years. The classes are of poor standard as are the coaches, and they only have about 2 gym racks for lifting which are a no-go post 5:30pm work. 

With crossfit/class based gyms I liked that you just turn up, great quality coaches are there, they have each day's workout ready to go, and give you a good level of coaching because of the small class size.   


Don't get me wrong, I used to go to a commercial gym and was really motivated, went every day and followed a program or eventually made up my own workouts. But it was an effort trying to figure out what to do every day when you're in work etc. Not to mention you're wondering if you're progressing correctly!","BJJ/Tae-Kwon-Do/Martial Arts beginners in Dublin, does it keep or get you in shape like the gym?",1552492403,"I recently started a new job in the city on Adelaide Rd off Harcourt St.

Then of course you've all the boxing clubs. Only ever did this as a training method to get fit for GAA in my teens, never gave it a proper go. It was tough and very old school training, facilities in boxing gyms are usually crap though.

I had to leave my crossfit gym which I loved since I joined early 2018. The community spirit in the gym and class based workouts capped at 12/14 really suited me.  


I joined a commercial gym - Icon Health Club on Camden St, which allows you access to Dartry Health Club & One Escape Smithfield (off peak upto 4pm & weekends). It's €65 a month which falls between the super fit super busy Flyefits/Ben Dunne's @ €30 a month, and the crazy dear ones beside me @ €150 upwards.  


Not the same at all, struggling to get back into it coming from the class based gyms as last few years. The classes are of poor standard as are the coaches, and they only have about 2 gym racks for lifting which are a no-go post 5:30pm work. 

With crossfit/class based gyms I liked that you just turn up, great quality coaches are there, they have each day's workout ready to go, and give you a good level of coaching because of the small class size.   


Don't get me wrong, I used to go to a commercial gym and was really motivated, went every day and followed a program or eventually made up my own workouts. But it was an effort trying to figure out what to do every day when you're in work etc. Not to mention you're wondering if you're progressing correctly!",13-03-2019 15:53,2019,

And it wasn’t just her gender which set the 7th Uachtarán na hÉireann apart from her predecessors. 

Stretching the legal boundaries and moral responsibilities of the essentially symbolic role to the very limit, she used her unique spotlight to challenge the establishment, raising human rights issues on both a national and international level. The former barrister and senator from Ballina had been courageously upsetting the apple cart for womens liberation in our nation for decades. 

She had been at the vanguard for liberalising an Ireland still very much under the thumb of the Catholic churches patriarchy. Robinson championed causes like the decriminalisation of homosexuality and legaling contraception and divorce.

Whilst extremely popular by most metrics, some of her stances, especially her criticism of Ireland's immigration policy, caused controversy during a time of economic hardship and unemployment. Our first female president was often characterised, for better or worse, as an internationally focused activist. Regardless of your opinion of her priorities, her passion for equality and celebration of her countries history and culture are hard to deny. 

Her famous inauguration speech was a sign of a new era to come. President Robinson said ‘I was elected by men and women of all parties and none, by many with great moral courage who stepped out from the faded flag of the civil war and voted for a new Ireland, and above all by the women of Ireland, mná na hÉireann, who instead of rocking the cradle rocked the system, and who came out massively to make their mark on the ballot paper and on a new Ireland.’",Mary Robinsons election,1699342309,"DUBLINTIMEMACHINE: On this day in 1990, the role of women in Irish politics changed forever with the election of our first female president, Mary Robinson.

610,cork,Eli2OBJ,32456,t3_1cj6cky,"I don’t browse here all that regularly, so I assume there have been many rants about Cork in this subreddit re: housing, anti-social behaviour etc. but I just want to add my own shout into the void.

I’ve been living in Cork for 26 years, bar some time spent abroad in Europe (loved it) and Dublin (hated it). I went to UCC and have been working full time and renting periodically in Cork since I moved back three years ago. Coming out of the pandemic Cork really felt like a place on the rise. It felt like Cork was making a collective effort to become a more vibrant, contemporary European city in regard to things like nightlife, the music and food scene, developments down the Marina and public spaces etc. That's what it felt like to me anyway.

Three years later I’m probably looking at things with an older, more critical eye of someone working, paying bills etc. but nothing in this city seems to be anywhere near the standard we should accept. Want somewhere to live? Good luck finding a house or anywhere reasonable to rent. Nightlife or eating out? Prepare to fork out half your weeks wages in mostly average bars and restaurants. Want to drive? Try waiting months for a driving test and paying exorbitant insurance and other fees driving in traffic on awful, unmaintained roads. Rely on public transport instead? Prepare to wait for late, overcrowded buses and cancellations without warning. Walk around the city centre and look at the crumbling buildings on the North Main Street or the vacant lots on Patrick Street, maybe attend the opening of yet another phone and vape shop. Stay clear of the constant anti-social behaviour and flagrant drug dealing on the Grand Parade and Daunt Square.

I accept that a lot of Corks issues are emblematic of the larger problems in Ireland as a whole but that can’t be an excuse in and of itself. In my own opinion, Cork is a city with notions of being a modern, mid-sized European City and it doesn’t meet any of the criteria for that. Those cities have their problems too but at least at surface level many of the issues blatantly apparent in Cork are not visible. Foreign nationals coming here have added massively to the vibe and the buzz in Cork and I welcome them, but I often wonder what they see in this place. Especially compared to other mid-sized European cities that I’ve travelled to that do everything so much better, are far cheaper and frankly are more pleasant places to live.

I love Cork I really do. The people here are great and there are so many positives to the place, I miss it every time I am away. I think the famous James Baldwin quote is pretty relevant here, “*I love America more than any other country in the world and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually*.” I just feel sometimes that all this ‘real capital’, ‘Cork is the best’ stuff masks an inconvenient truth that we don’t really accept, Cork City isn’t that great anymore, especially for a young person.

I’m sure people may disagree with me, I am after all just another langer giving his two cents but that’s just how I feel. ",Cork City isn't all that great anymore,1714735794,"I don’t browse here all that regularly, so I assume there have been many rants about Cork in this subreddit re: housing, anti-social behaviour etc. but I just want to add my own shout into the void.

I’ve been living in Cork for 26 years, bar some time spent abroad in Europe (loved it) and Dublin (hated it). I went to UCC and have been working full time and renting periodically in Cork since I moved back three years ago. Coming out of the pandemic Cork really felt like a place on the rise. It felt like Cork was making a collective effort to become a more vibrant, contemporary European city in regard to things like nightlife, the music and food scene, developments down the Marina and public spaces etc. That's what it felt like to me anyway.

Three years later I’m probably looking at things with an older, more critical eye of someone working, paying bills etc. but nothing in this city seems to be anywhere near the standard we should accept. Want somewhere to live? Good luck finding a house or anywhere reasonable to rent. Nightlife or eating out? Prepare to fork out half your weeks wages in mostly average bars and restaurants. Want to drive? Try waiting months for a driving test and paying exorbitant insurance and other fees driving in traffic on awful, unmaintained roads. Rely on public transport instead? Prepare to wait for late, overcrowded buses and cancellations without warning. Walk around the city centre and look at the crumbling buildings on the North Main Street or the vacant lots on Patrick Street, maybe attend the opening of yet another phone and vape shop. Stay clear of the constant anti-social behaviour and flagrant drug dealing on the Grand Parade and Daunt Square.

I accept that a lot of Corks issues are emblematic of the larger problems in Ireland as a whole but that can’t be an excuse in and of itself. In my own opinion, Cork is a city with notions of being a modern, mid-sized European City and it doesn’t meet any of the criteria for that. Those cities have their problems too but at least at surface level many of the issues blatantly apparent in Cork are not visible. Foreign nationals coming here have added massively to the vibe and the buzz in Cork and I welcome them, but I often wonder what they see in this place. Especially compared to other mid-sized European cities that I’ve travelled to that do everything so much better, are far cheaper and frankly are more pleasant places to live.

I've been doing temp work while I look for something full time, staying in a short-term housing arrangement on a very good rate. Sadly, that rate will be increasing soon, and I've been keeping an eye out for other options. 

I've been directed to the various facebook groups circulating accommodation (as well as Daft, obviously) and I notice that many of the posts are targeted exclusively at specific demographic groups, the most frequent seeming to be Brazilian. This is no problem to me; I speak Spanish and I'd gladly try to learn Portuguese. But most of the people posting express a preference for their own nationality. 

This seems like a good way to find a better deal, but I never see any posts requesting my nationality in particular (American).

Finding Americans isn't exactly why I came here, but it seems like a good way to find a market niche where I'm a slightly more appealing tenant.

I am first generation Irish male of my immigrant parents (HK) and have been born and raised here. I had traveled and lived abroad for a number of years and know how lonely/difficult it can be meeting new permanent friends. Either you meet fellow travellers and they leave, or the occasional local which leads to nothing.

Im wondering if anyone would be interested in a legit hang out group that doesn’t mainly involve drinking/partying. Im in my 30s now and am really over going to any sort of parties of excessive drinking. Don’t get me wrong I love a few Guinnesses but not to the point that every hangout revolves around that.

My group of childhood friends are great, but mostly have children now or wants to go to the pub to drink our night away which results the new few days being a write off.

If interested, maybe we can all organise something and get to know each other? About myself, I love going out in nature walks and drive outside Dublin to go for walks regularly. So anything outdoors is always a winner for me. I love football and hope to go to some league of Ireland games in 2024. I started bouldering/climbing in early 2023 and want to start again in 2024 so can join me if interested. Regularly go to gigs and can be bit of a music snob of mainstream music and listen to my indie/underground type. 

Also like checking out new cafes around Dublin and am quite active with gym and home yoga. Started late 2023 going to see theatre plays and hope to do more. I have travelled/lived for many years in my my 20s to Europe, Asia, Aus and S.America. Can also speak Cantonese but cannot read/write and trying to learn Brazilian Portuguese as my gf is Brazilian.

I’m mostly keen on anything so if you feel we could click, send a message and if enough I can create a WhatsApp group for everyone.

I'm willing to pursue my dream of learning about the mind and helping people overcome their challenges in life. Problem is, back from where I'm from, the careers of psychologist and psychotherapist are blended together in the same (Psychology).

This distinction brings a tremendous challenge: I have to choose  between the two careers. I've been trying to understand the differences, doing a lot of research, but couldn't find much relevant and precise information about it. 

&#x200B;

I want to understand what are the differences between those two regarding what you learn in the College, how the careers and jobs available differ, wages, work routine, etc.

&#x200B;

Is there anyone available for a chat about it? I don't mind receiving long whatsapp audios or paying you a coffee in the city center in exchange for info. 

&#x200B;

I know this might not be the best place to ask, but I'm feeling lost and overwhelmend with the (lack of) information. If I can't choose between courses, I can't plan and act accordingly, which is stressing me out lately.

635,Dublin,Cogitoergosum1981,80847,t3_18dj5oj,"DUBLINTIMEMACHINE: Did you know there's a statue of the british Prince Albert outside that bastion of Irishness Leinster House? Queen Victoria's husbands likeness was erected in 1872 when Dublin was very much a part of the empire. Albert had died in 1861 and became more famous in death due to the Victorian obsession with mourning, which his departure caused.

The royal couple had visited their (dis)loyal subjects in Dublin a few times in 1849, 1853, and 1861. Artist John Henry Foleys' work depicts the prince on a plinth, surrounded by four youths: a shepherd, an artist, a tradesman, and an explorer. They symbolise the colonisers' main hobbies: agriculture, arts, industry, and science.

For a time, the Prince Consort's memorial statue was joined nearby by an extremely unpopular sculpture of his rotund wife/cousin Queen Vic. Her's was thankfully taken down in 1948 and eventually shipped off to Syndey. Unsurprisingly, Albert's statue was not without its detractors either. Within days of its unveiling there were attempts to blow it up. 

But it stood the test of time. Its only major change being relocation to another part of the Leinster House lawn, firstly in 1923 and again in 1950 to make way for the far more appropriate memorial for Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins and Kevin O`Higgin. 

The controversial bronze statue of a foreign royal was even renovated at expense to the taxpayer as recently as in 2004. There have been perennial petitions seeking its removal from Leinster House. However, as of 2023, it has been given another stay of execution. Statues of the old invaders ruling family once dotted Dublin, but with the exception of old Bertie, they have all gone the way of Nelsons pillar; blown up! 

Some examples of demolished despots are King George II in Stephen’s Green (1758-1937), William of Orange on his horse in Dame Street(1701-1946).
In 1958, Foley’s statue which depicted the Earl of Carlisle, in the Phoenix Park (1870- 1958) and the equestrian monument to Lord Gough ( 1880- 1957).

Personally, I don’t believe in destroying statues, regardless of how politically incorrect they are. However, I do believe they should be removed from their lofty esteemed locations and put in museums, where the context of the individual depicted can be better interpreted.",Prince Albert,1702027525,"DUBLINTIMEMACHINE: Did you know there's a statue of the british Prince Albert outside that bastion of Irishness Leinster House?

A. I am feeling a bit anxious. I know I will find a place but need some reaffirmation so I could stop being anxious.

I got a good job offer from a good company in Dublin. I did some research on my own for Dublin:  


1. It is not in the Schengen area, so I have to apply for a VISA whenever I want to travel.
2. Housing is very expensive, let's say in general Dublin is expensive as compared to Munich
3. As I am looking for stability, If I want to be a Permanent Resident I have to start again and the period is somewhere 5 years in Ireland, but in Munich, I can apply for Permanent Residency in Germany in another 10-12 Months I know a bit of German.
4. Healthcare/Public Transportation is much better in Munich as compared to Ireland.
5. People are very friendly in Dublin as compared to Munich.

I am really confused by the dinamic of Bachelors Walk bike lane. There is a well defined bike lane on the right side of the street until bus stop 315. Then the bike lane become thinner, disappers and reappears on the left side of the street. Between these two points there is this weird traffic light that seems like a crosswalk but it is not one, and also these blue signs with white arrows pointing down. Then, after some meters the red bike lane on the left side disappers again. You can see the drawing of a bicycle on the right lane of the street, but cannot see any bike lane. After some more meters and in front of The Bachelor Inn Bar, a new red bike lane appears on the right side of the left street lane (a bus lane), which is literaly in the middle of the street.

This bike lane moves to the left side of the left lane of the street again at the intersection of O'Connell Street.

So, from what a understood, I am supposed to cross three lanes into a bus lane while riding my bicycle, then cross the bus lane again to the middle of the street and do it one more time to the same side I previously was, while crossing a busy, big intersection with a bus right behind me.

From everything I pointed I can raise three hypotheses:

1 - I am too stupid to understand this highly complex, first world bike lane dynamics; or

2 - This layout is deliberate and the government wants to eliminate cyclists by driving buses over them; or

3 - The government tried to update the bike lanes and move them of place, but did this just for one part of the street and forgot the other.

If you are able to explain me how this works I would be really grateful. Sorry about eventual English mistakes, it is not my first language.

676,Dublin,Cogitoergosum1981,81491,t3_18sqd4h,"DUBLINTIMEMACHINE: A warning from history today. 17th-century English experienced a murderous mass hysteria called “Irish Fright”. They believed innocent minority communities of Paddies were conspiring to massacre English people all over their country. 

It is 1688, a period known as the Glorious Revolution. Catholic King James II's was unable to escape to exile in France and his days are numbered. Across Britain, in addition to the regular Irish worker population, there are small units of demobilised Irish Jacobite soldiers. Most are sheepishly making their way home.

Anxiety about these """"sleeper cells"""" feeds a moral panic in England that Ireland wants revenge for usurping their sympathetic king. Rumours circulate across the massive Protestant-majority country that their Irish servants, soldiers and workers are plotting to rise up across the land and massacre their masters and English locals.

In a 17th century case of “fake news” fictional reports arrive in London that the Irish have gone on the rampage burning rural towns and putting small cities to the sword. Any unexplained disappearance, disaster or disease was blamed on the foreign scapegoat.
 
There was a great anxiety among many English settlements which had made their fortune on the theft and destruction of their Irish counterparts that finally a reckoning for all their sins and plunder was about to occur.

Where there is guilt there is fear. And surely the revenge for centuries of barbarism would be unimaginably bloody? This lethal propaganda naturally stirs up the terrified English locals. Anti-Irish panic sparks pograms. Lifelong neighbours torch homes and take lives. Xenophobic chaos breakout. They quickly form militias and imprison or murder every Irish civilian in sight. 

The Irish Fright lasts only days but it is long enough to result in the murder of hundreds of innocent “foreigners”, uproot and destroy centuries-old communities and alliances and change the relationship between the Irish allies in England forever.

The first tangible chapter in the violent fantasy was an account from the 13th of December 1688. Bishop Gilbert Burnet in London sent a desperate warning to his peers. 

""""Country Fellows [Irish agricultural workers] arriving about Midnight at Westminster caused a sudden Uproar, by Reporting that the Irish, in desperate Rage, were advancing to London, and putting all before them to Fire and Sword."""" 

When this message was received by another parish it was relayed again. This time with the additional fearmongering order """"Rise, arm, arm! the Irish are cutting throats'. A well-respected clergyman from Leicestershire called  Theophilus Brookes raised a militia so massive and relentless that even days after the fog of war had lifted he could still not disband them. 

This feverish rallying call raised citizen armies in their thousands as hour by hour more bizarre, bloody and entirely fictional reports arrived. The Irish had besieged Birmingham, burned Cambridge and put Norwich to the sword! They were sparing none, neither women nor children. They would be at the gates of Whitehall by dawn to massacre Parliament.

Later investigation of the source of the catastrophic lies pointed at Orangist sympathisers. These disciples of King William, particularly Marshal Duke of Schomberg, wished to seal the fate of his already deposed rival, whilst also neutralising untold masses of innocent non-political paddies along with him.  

Further investigations a century later ascribed some of the scare to starving marauding Irish soldiers who, having grown mad with hunger and despised by English locals, were driven to steal food from farms and villages. An 18th-century account described their desperate situation.

""""The disbanded Troops finding themselves Money-less, and incapable of subsisting in a Country where they were so generally hated, took it into their Heads to force open a Country House, to keep themselves from starving. Upon this, a Man in the Neighbourhood ran directly to London”.

Considering the despicable wanton violence and scapegoating which saw mobs of mindless thugs combine with agent provocateurs to disgrace and destroy our capital city on 23rd November lessons of historic moral panic and barbarism are more relevant today than ever.

Well, like all good Irish folk tunes, it’s about emigration and longing for home. In this instance, a young economic migrant journeying from his impoverished home in Tuam to Liverpool.

The tune struck a chord in the English music hall scene when charismatic singer Harry Clifton (1832–1872) made it a popular staple that audiences could sing and dance along to.  Now you’ve likely heard a variation on these original lyrics, as the song has mutated and modernised to suit the audience and the changing socio-economics of Anglo-Irish relations.

The song begins with saying farewell to family and friends and Tuam, with agricultural allusions, when our hero is """"off to reap the corn,"""" in other words, to make his fortune.

Sadly, the conditions of his voyage continue to detour from the frying pan to the fryer. When he boards his ship for Liverpool, he`s thrown in with the pigs in the cargo hold where he suffers severe sea sickness, and presumably several other porcine related conditions enroute to Holyhead. 

When our unfortunate adventurer finally gets to Liverpool, he experiences further anti-Paddy sentiment.

I would like to know what do Irish people look into while hiring someone? I would like to get into a part time job as soon as I land there. Is it easy to land into part time jobs or will it be a tough call?

Please drop in as many recommendations as possible- resume crafting, professional clothing advice, any soft skills, or anything else that is in demand and can help me if I have those skills. 

Thanks in advance :)",09-04-2022 07:35,2022,

712,Dublin,Human-Focus-475,85138,t3_1c3tkij,"This account is a throwaway for personal reasons, because I don't know how many other people there might see this post and be able to identify me, but I still want people to know about the conditions of city centre.  

I am an American (18M) from the New York area who has been living in Dublin since summer last year. I am also an Irish passport holder, because my family is originally Irish. Being from the states, I am used to the occasional hassle by teenagers or drug addicts,  but what happened last night really compares to nothing I have felt before. This is especially a surprise to me because I have been in sketchy NYC neighborhoods past dark on multiple occasions but have never really had anything like this happen.  

Last night, at around 8:30 PM, my Chinese friend and I were walking out of Taste of Hong Kong, a restaurant on Moore Street which is in the same building as the ILAC Shopping Centre. A group of around 8-10 kids, no more than 12-14 years old made some snarky comments about my friend being Chinese. He gave them the middle finger, and then the """"ringleader"""", a shorter, chubbier kid called him a ch-nk. I didn't want to escalate the situation, so I just played it off and went along with it. I regret this, because I didn't realize how that comment might have made my friend feel, and, if I had stood up earlier, it might not have gotten worse.  

After that happened, my friend and I continued walking in the same direction as them towards Henry Street. This is when we saw the chubby kid and one other crawl underneath one of the newsstands and pull out a box of leftover or rotten fruit. He began throwing them at random around the street. The throws weren't also just random tossing. They had a lot of force behind them. My friend and I lingered a bit behind because we didn't want to get hit.

In front of us was a pair of girls who weren't of Irish origin, maybe Brazilian or Middle Eastern. They were walking in the opposite direction of us, towards Parnell Street. One of the apples that the chubby kid threw hit one of the girls smack in the face, very hard. After that happened, I started yelling and cursing out the kids. I said some very hateful things with my full chest, which made them start throwing apples at me. Fortunately, I did not get hit. We were still going in the same direction until we got to Henry Street, where they began walking towards Jervis Street, and my friend and I towards O'Connell Street.  

At this point, my friend was on the phone with the gardaí. We decided not to file a police report, because we knew nothing would happen to the kids, and because I'm not familiar with the Irish legal system and don't want to be. I don't know what happened to the two girls, and I really regret not checking in on them. If, on the off chance that one of you guys is reading this, I hope you are OK. Or, if someone recognizes them in this story, just please give them my sympathy. Really.  

When it comes down to it, I don't necessarily want the kids to be punished. I realize that they probably have it pretty awful at home. My biggest concern is for their safety. I already think that I'm the wrong person to try and pull something like that on, but, luckily, I was able to mostly restrain myself, apart from shouting. However, I really do think that, one day, they will try something like that again, and really meet the wrong person, who could seriously go after them. I really hope that there can be some sort of solution to this problem, because it is not very long before one of these young kids are going to seriously hurt someone, or get seriously hurt themselves.

737,Dublin,Apprehensive_Net_630,69307,t3_zoy12m,"It has been a really long time since the accident happened to me. I finally have the courage to write down my story. 

About half a year ago, I was a master's student in UCD and was really busy with my study. It is always very hard to find a room in Dublin. I paid Hosting Power €480 for the service fee and rent a room. They say they would help me to view the room and I didn't get a chance to view it by myself. 

I remember that I moved in that house at the end of the May. Then I noticed that the room was really small and all the equipments are really old. The toilet even can't flush and it doesn't has a lock. I can't lock my room either. 
I lived with the landlady(an old lady in her 70s),  her daughter and the daughter's boyfriend. They always came into my room without my permission. I can tell that the daughter and the daughter's boyfriend are mentally disabled. When the landlady was away, the couple were using drugs all the day. They don't have jobs just stay at home and wait for the landlady to feed them. 
Two weeks later, the landlady was away for the weekends. They were using drugs for the whole weekend. On the Monday when I back from college, I tried to take money to pay for the rent. Then I found all of my money was gone (they left me €5😅). I had around €2200 in my schoolbag. I had to pay for my rent by cash so I didn't lodge it to my bank. And it was all the money I had till graduate. 

That day I freaked out. I went to the Garda station immediately. I made the statement. But surprisingly, they don't wanna help me. They say I should ask help from the Chinese embassy or the college. Then I contacted both of them but they say I should go to the Garda. Anyway, nobody could help me 😅 I tried all the methods to get my money back but there isn't hope at all. I brought the paperbag which I used to cover the cash but the Garda didn't take it. 

The only useful information I got was from the neighbors in the Garda station. They told me that family was known for stealing and addiction. And the guy was criminal. So clearly Hosting Power didn't do anything for me before I moved in. 
When I back from the Garda Station, I found the daughter was watching through the window. I ran away immediately. The next day I had a presentation to do but I left my laptop in that house 😂

Then I went to my friends place to sleep that day. My friends are all girls so I thought I should ask help from someone to go to that house to take my stuff. I wrote to Hosting Power. But clearly they ignored me. The next day I asked two guys from my course to help me. When we got there, the landlady closed all the windows and started to blaming me I went to the Garda without inform her. I guess if my classmates weren't there at that day I would be really in dangerous. 

 The next days I tried all the methods to contact Hosting Power. Few days later they finally responded. 

""""I have activated a free rebooking on your account, so can move to another property."""" 

This means they even didn't want to refund the service fee at the beginning. 

""""I would like to inform you that Hosting Power Ltd will never place a Guest at a property if it is known that any information may lead to suspicious or illegal behaviour from the host, but it must be understood that the behaviour of the Host cannot be guaranteed.
Unfortunately no compensation can be offered, however I would like to confirm once again that we have processed your refund for the service fee.""""

About one month later I finally got my service fee refund but didn't get any other help from them. The customer service I talked to was really rude which made me even sadder. 

I had a really bad time after that. I am glad my friends are always there. I had my final project and two classes to take at that time. And I had to get up at 3 am to do a part time job to support my living.
I am glad I went through that time and everything is alright for me now. It's always hard to study abroad.

Hi,
I'm traveling to the states for a week and the international roaming charges on an Irish sim looks expensive so I'm planning to buy an e-sim from the US network provider. As of now I can see 'Tello' network has some good deals. I was wondering if anyone of you have bought a local sim while traveling in the states and if so which one do you suggest me to buy. I'll be traveling in the Philadelphia and New york region. 

Also, what documents are asked at the immigration?

Hi! My coworker lives close to the immigration office in dublin 2 where multiple tents have popped up over the past weeks. Previously they were on the street where offices from the government are at, but now they are in front of family houses/ apartments and it is too much

First off thank you for taking the time to read through this. 

As the title states, I'll be moving from Holland/Amsterdam to Ireland/Dublin as part of moving to a new job working for a software vendor. 

Everyone talks about the housing market. How bad is it currently (Q4/2017)? Specifically, my office will be around a place called Sandyford/Dundrum. I would prefer not to spend more than 1k/month on rent for a single bedroom apartment. If that means I need to go look a bit further out, so be it. 

1. Where would one recommend for me to start looking. And at what places / surrounding areas would you recommend?

2. How does commuting work? Is public transport reliable? As in Japan reliable or Ukraine reliable? Is it common that people commute on bicycles? 

3. Can one live comfortably on 85K/year OTE (or 65K base) and save? 
4. Perhaps a better question would be, whats the average income in Dublin for 25-30 year olds and whats their living situation like, on average? I read that many people share apartments and even rooms?

5. Is Dublin similar to the UK in terms of work legislation i.e. can an employer fire you pretty easily, bad social security, sloppy healthcare, or is it quite the opposite? 

6. It seems you drive on the left? 

Any input is really appreciated!

I became friends a few months ago with a man from Togo, in Africa, who has been living in Ireland for around a year and a bit at this stage. He has been homeless basically the whole time - originally in Cork and now in Dublin (I think he was living under direct provision at first but thankfully was accepted as a refugee). He has a PPSN and all the correct legal documents to live and work in Ireland, and me and a friend even got him a steady job as a kitchen porter a while back, but we're finding it next to impossible to find him solid accommodation in Dublin. 
His English isn't good (he speaks French; this is how I mostly communicate with him), so it's difficult to convince people to take him on as a flatmate when there's such a glut of people looking for rental accommodation in the city, given that his English is such a work in progress. He knows a decent amount of phrases in English, but he has never been able to afford to go to classes so his knowledge is quite limited.
He's an extremely kind guy - really, really considerate guy who can keep to himself but also is more than happy to help out with tasks; if he was living in a safe place he'd be absolutely more than happy to do household chores. He's a bright fella, he just lacks a lot of confidence because he lacks the language skills to engage with Irish people in a fluent manner. At the moment he's staying partially in backpackers hostels (which is eating up his precious saved funds for a deposit on accom), sometimes on my couch and sometimes in a warehouse space another friend of mine is renting - but it's a situation that can't keep going much longer. I really want to find him a solid place to live in the city that will allow him to settle his mind and start integrating properly into Irish society. With the right base, he can thrive; I feel he has a lot to give to our society.

If anyone out there reads this and can help me in any way (if someone knows of a good value room anywhere near the city centre who would take him on [he will take a shared room of course]), please comment underneath or send me a private mail. Any tips or anything at all would be a huge help. I've been going around the major homeless charity offices but they're inundated with requests to be honest. also, because my friend from Togo works in a kitchen during the daytime, he's generally not available to accompany me to the drop in centres. I also have to work to pay my own rent, so I'm not always available to be helping him.
With winter approaching I'm really desperate to find him some proper accommodation.

Anyway, thanks for reading :)

His English isn't good (he speaks French; this is how I mostly communicate with him), so it's difficult to convince people to take him on as a flatmate when there's such a glut of people looking for rental accommodation in the city, given that his English is such a work in progress. He knows a decent amount of phrases in English, but he has never been able to afford to go to classes so his knowledge is quite limited.
He's an extremely kind guy - really, really considerate guy who can keep to himself but also is more than happy to help out with tasks; if he was living in a safe place he'd be absolutely more than happy to do household chores. He's a bright fella, he just lacks a lot of confidence because he lacks the language skills to engage with Irish people in a fluent manner. At the moment he's staying partially in backpackers hostels (which is eating up his precious saved funds for a deposit on accom), sometimes on my couch and sometimes in a warehouse space another friend of mine is renting - but it's a situation that can't keep going much longer. I really want to find him a solid place to live in the city that will allow him to settle his mind and start integrating properly into Irish society. With the right base, he can thrive; I feel he has a lot to give to our society.

If anyone out there reads this and can help me in any way (if someone knows of a good value room anywhere near the city centre who would take him on [he will take a shared room of course]), please comment underneath or send me a private mail. Any tips or anything at all would be a huge help. I've been going around the major homeless charity offices but they're inundated with requests to be honest. also, because my friend from Togo works in a kitchen during the daytime, he's generally not available to accompany me to the drop in centres. I also have to work to pay my own rent, so I'm not always available to be helping him.
With winter approaching I'm really desperate to find him some proper accommodation.

Anyway, thanks for reading :)

I am worried about how difficult it could be to find a job there, and how much the salary should be. Looking online some pages say around 35k to 40k and others about 45k -50K, and I think that is a huge difference. I guess I am just not sure about what skill range I should be in.

When I moved to Switzerland I took an offer that was too low. Not because I didn't do my research, but because I was moving as a foreigner (doubted my german skills and not sure how the requirements in Switzerland would be for work) and desperate to get out of Spain. Thankfully my employer was pretty honest and gave me a huge raise after 3 months (42k  to 70k)  and even apologised. However, I do not want to take the risk of getting a not-so-honest employer in Dublin.

842,Dublin,Cogitoergosum1981,81249,t3_18lxfsp,"DUBLINTIMEMACHINE: Warning: This trip in the time machine deals with illegal abortion and a specific controversial individual. Mamie Cadden was one of the most infamous women in Ireland during the early 20th century.

Born Mary Anne Caden in 1891 in the USA to Irish parents, she came to Dublin to work as a midwife at the National Maternity Hospital before setting up nursing homes and becoming a backstreet abortionist. The law and Catholic ethos of 20th century Ireland were entwined, each expressly forbidding abortion under any circumstance. 

Along with this prohibition, girls and women had no access to contraception, which inevitably resulted in unwanted or unviable pregnancies. People sought solutions to their personal crises outside the law, and often due to the inexperience or lack of regulation involved in these operations,  they resulted in tragedy.

Whilst many girls and women were exiled to the prison camps of Magdeline Laundries, females who already had children to raise could not be so easily disposed of. Fathers could not be deprived of their wives.

It was in this society of “no contraception, no marital rape,no hope” that the phenomena of amateur or even self-delivered abortion took hold. The only sliver of matriarchal control lay within the semi-independent world of midwifery.And it was in to this then murky grey-area that Caddens criminal trade thrived.

The medical and legal professions of the time were monopolised by men. Men in white coats, men with collars in dresses and funny hats. Whilst women were superficially worshipped in their plaster and paint form as divine virgins and saints, actual flesh and blood female bodies were not their own. 

This meant a life of perpetual pregnancies for most Catholic wives. A litter of kids, poorly provided for by the state which necessitated their creation. Families starved and froze for lack of  food or accommodation. Infant and child mortality were shockingly high, as was the brutal death rate for women.

From 1929 to 1931, Mamie Cadden owned and ran a large gaff in Rathmines, converting it into a maternity nursing home with illegal terminations behind its seldom-male-visited closed doors. When word got around, Mamie and her staff could scarcely keep up with the demand.

She expanded, buying a massive nursing home in Rathmines . This institution, called “St. Maelruin” not only catered for the above and below board maternity issues, it was also an orphanage-come-fosterhome for unwanted infants and children born. Cadden effectively sold foundlings to adoptive parents. It was around this point that Cadden began to feel like an untouchable celebrity. Flushed with wealth and influence, connected to some of the most powerful families in the state, she was a socialite on the Dublin scene, driving everywhere in her red open-top 1932 MG sports car! 

Despite being linked with numberous injuries and deaths, nothing would stick until a tragedy in 1939. Cadden was charged with heartlessly abandoning and a newborn baby on the side of the road in County Meath. The child nearly died of exposure. Mamie was sentenced to a year's hard labour in Mountjoy Prison. Struck off all medical registers, and with massive debts and legal expenses, she was forced to sell St Maelruin whilst still in prison.

The charges against Cadden were extremely serious and viewed with little compassion for either her or her patients at the time. Child abandonment attempts to procure a miscarriage and murder. In addition to the legal condemnation, her name was on the lips of every priest, spouted from every pulpit in the land. 

Her name became synonymous with a boogie woman, her title """"Mamie,"""" the ironic antithesis of motherhood. She served several prison terms between 1939 and 1945. Her most infamous brush with the law was when she was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a 33 year old patient called Helen O'Reilly. The desperate patient had been 5 months pregnant when she died in agony due to an air embolism during an abortion. 

Cadden was sentenced to hang in 1956, but this was commuted to life imprisonment in Mountjoy. A year later, Mamie was declared criminally insane and transferred to Dundrum lunatic asylum, where she would die in 1959 of a heart attack, age 67.

https://rotunda.ie/crisis-pregnancy/",Mamie Cadden,1702976003,"DUBLINTIMEMACHINE: Warning: This trip in the time machine deals with illegal abortion and a specific controversial individual. Mamie Cadden was one of the most infamous women in Ireland during the early 20th century.

Born Mary Anne Caden in 1891 in the USA to Irish parents, she came to Dublin to work as a midwife at the National Maternity Hospital before setting up nursing homes and becoming a backstreet abortionist. The law and Catholic ethos of 20th century Ireland were entwined, each expressly forbidding abortion under any circumstance. 

Along with this prohibition, girls and women had no access to contraception, which inevitably resulted in unwanted or unviable pregnancies. People sought solutions to their personal crises outside the law, and often due to the inexperience or lack of regulation involved in these operations,  they resulted in tragedy.

Whilst many girls and women were exiled to the prison camps of Magdeline Laundries, females who already had children to raise could not be so easily disposed of. Fathers could not be deprived of their wives.

It was in this society of “no contraception, no marital rape,no hope” that the phenomena of amateur or even self-delivered abortion took hold. The only sliver of matriarchal control lay within the semi-independent world of midwifery.And it was in to this then murky grey-area that Caddens criminal trade thrived.

The medical and legal professions of the time were monopolised by men. Men in white coats, men with collars in dresses and funny hats. Whilst women were superficially worshipped in their plaster and paint form as divine virgins and saints, actual flesh and blood female bodies were not their own. 

This meant a life of perpetual pregnancies for most Catholic wives. A litter of kids, poorly provided for by the state which necessitated their creation. Families starved and froze for lack of  food or accommodation. Infant and child mortality were shockingly high, as was the brutal death rate for women.

From 1929 to 1931, Mamie Cadden owned and ran a large gaff in Rathmines, converting it into a maternity nursing home with illegal terminations behind its seldom-male-visited closed doors. When word got around, Mamie and her staff could scarcely keep up with the demand.

She expanded, buying a massive nursing home in Rathmines . This institution, called “St. Maelruin” not only catered for the above and below board maternity issues, it was also an orphanage-come-fosterhome for unwanted infants and children born. Cadden effectively sold foundlings to adoptive parents. It was around this point that Cadden began to feel like an untouchable celebrity. Flushed with wealth and influence, connected to some of the most powerful families in the state, she was a socialite on the Dublin scene, driving everywhere in her red open-top 1932 MG sports car! 

Despite being linked with numberous injuries and deaths, nothing would stick until a tragedy in 1939. Cadden was charged with heartlessly abandoning and a newborn baby on the side of the road in County Meath. The child nearly died of exposure. Mamie was sentenced to a year's hard labour in Mountjoy Prison. Struck off all medical registers, and with massive debts and legal expenses, she was forced to sell St Maelruin whilst still in prison.

The charges against Cadden were extremely serious and viewed with little compassion for either her or her patients at the time. Child abandonment attempts to procure a miscarriage and murder. In addition to the legal condemnation, her name was on the lips of every priest, spouted from every pulpit in the land. 

Her name became synonymous with a boogie woman, her title """"Mamie,"""" the ironic antithesis of motherhood. She served several prison terms between 1939 and 1945. Her most infamous brush with the law was when she was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a 33 year old patient called Helen O'Reilly. The desperate patient had been 5 months pregnant when she died in agony due to an air embolism during an abortion. 

Cadden was sentenced to hang in 1956, but this was commuted to life imprisonment in Mountjoy. A year later, Mamie was declared criminally insane and transferred to Dundrum lunatic asylum, where she would die in 1959 of a heart attack, age 67.

I’m a 22-year-old Brazilian who has an aunt living in Dublin and she has asked me several times whether or not I have interest in living with her a couple months while studying and working. Obviously the idea seems exciting, as I wouldn’t have to worry about rent, food etc and I’m currently doing nothing here in Brazil.

The thing is, courses who allow me to get a Stamp 2 are English courses either for business or for preparation exams, but those don’t appeal to me, since I already hold Advanced Cambridge certificates dating back to 2018, from when I used to study English in school. So I thought I should try and see if there are more options out there (say, another language course, like French), but apparently I’d have to be in a university if I want anything other than English. That kinda discouraging, ‘cause I was deeply considering the idea, but it seems I might have to give up. 

Does anyone anything about that? I just started to make my research, so I might be mistaken and could use help from people who have a better understanding of how this works than I do.","I wanted to do something with my life and study/work in Dublin, since there is nothing keeping me in Brazil at the moment.

Hello everyone!

My girlfriend and I are exploring the idea of moving to Ireland for two years under the working holiday visa from Canada. Currently, we're leaning towards Cork due to its appealing features. We're seeking a change of pace and scenery, and Ireland seems to offer a straightforward visa process for individuals in our age bracket (30-35).

I have a couple of questions, and I'd appreciate any insights you could share.

Firstly, regarding renting, we have two cats. I've come across information on this subreddit suggesting that having pets, especially as foreigners, might pose a challenge. Would it be advisable to omit this detail when applying? Also, given the rental crisis, any tips on finding a place would be greatly appreciated. We're familiar with a similar situation in Canada, so we're prepared for challenges.

Secondly, we're curious about the job market and the most in-demand roles. My girlfriend is currently a listings coordinator for a real estate company, and I work as a site supervisor at a security company. Do you think we could potentially find similar positions in Ireland? A quick search on Indeed shows numerous openings in the city, especially for temporary positions.

Lastly, we're interested in understanding the landscape of everyday racism in Ireland. My girlfriend and I are both Canadians. I am white, but she is indigenous to Canada and visibly not white. Are there any social hurdles or challenges she might face?

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and we appreciate any advice or information you can provide! Any other advice and input is appreciated.

I will miss the unknown people with whom I somehow managed to share the same dart compartment everyday of my commute, 
I will miss the coffee guy who made sure he remembered my name amongst all his hundreds of customers.
I will miss the calm the greenery.

I don't have Irish visa not sure I would be able to return (only as a tourist maybe)
But thanks for everything.

Hope you keep the city/country as is.

Adios 👋🏾

Recently I was hoping to make the move from hospitality management and night shifts to a day job, and through applying on indeed secured an interview and then offered the position for a direct provision center. 

It seemed good, big place of over 100 residents all men and sharing rooms of 2 or 3. The current staff is two chefs two manager two cleaners and two night porters, all of which have been in their roles for five ten years etc. It was clean and the kitchen very modern, most of the residents working so only around at night time and get fed meals through the kitchen. Over half of the 100 have gotten their papers and are supposed to be sorting alternative accommodation but they are given a grace period of a year or two for this with the current accommodation crisis.

There are a few individuals who have been residents for many years, think six or seven, but from chatting to them it seemed to be because they liked the place so much and were able to earn a wage without paying for room and board they were happy to stay as long as possible.

Fast forward I was telling some family members about the job offer and my older sister launched into how direct provision is unethical etc and I should not take the job.

I did my own research following and yes it seems amnesty international has condemned Direct Provision, along with some other large human rights groups.

My thinking is that like any privatised enterprise there is potential for unethical practices, but this particular place seemed nice and well run, with owners that care about the welfare of its tenants.

I'm from India, and recently I got admitted into this college for Ms in Data Science. I was wondering, how is the situation there?

- Like I heard the housing crisis. Is it serious?
- I heard from someone who is living in Dublin (a native guy) that finding jobs is extremely difficult. Is that true?
- Recently, there had been so many protests happening, so like is it safe for immigrants? 
- I'm interested in startups and business, so would love to know how is the startup culture in Galway or in Ireland in general.
- Is there anything I should know before coming there?


Thanks for help. Please understand that with these questions I'm not trying to offend anyone. I just need some details and information from people who are actually living in Galway.

So currently my children are in British school (not in the uk), both speak English as their first language, but can speak Spanish as well.

Madrid 
+weather
+affordable living costs 
+prices and quality of food 
+lots of decent bilingual schools (private) 
-low salaries 
-fewer opportunities? 
-less economic and personal freedom 

Dublin
+more opportunities 
+one of the best countries in Europe for secondary education (2nd best in europe and among the top ten worldwide according to pisa rankings) 
+after 5 years you can apply for Irish citizenship that gives you the right to live, travel, work and study within the Common Travel Area which is a huge plus in case my children would like to study or live in the UK
-housing crisis 

I feel like safety, friendliness of locals and healthcare in both cities are in pair with each other so not much to to consider there but would love to hear your thoughts.

Madrid unemployment rate 9-13%

So basically this happened about 7 years ago when I was merely a 13 years old  boy, I had a student leap card (which supposedly should have been cheaper to travel with but wasn't, charged the same) and one day I was almost late to school with my brother so we run and the gates at our station (Grand Canal Dock) were open but we still used our leap card on the gates and ran through (now I should mention that the screen were blank or at least text wasn't visible and sometimes they didn't give out that beep sound). Now we are down 3 station and when we get down we met with inspector who check our card but it said that we didn't used our card, but calmly I tried to explain that the gates at our station were wide open and we were in hurry so either the gate we used weren't functioning (which they weren't btw, I checked when we went home) and told them I would be more than happy to show them by going back there or to use my card the at another gate and come back but they just kept asking us for our address (which we didn't know since we just recently moved and our address was like really long and Irish, btw I am foreign so English wasn't my first language, in fact I only spoke at a beginner level). So they started to gang up on us with the other inspector (as they thought we were pranking or something because we didn't know our own address) and even brought up calling the police but in the end they just give both of us a fine of 100-150 (cant really remember) and took our leap card saying that when we go to pick up our card and pay the fine we get it back (since it was a student leap card it served us a identification for us).

The Screen Cinema was a three-screen cinema in Hawkins Street, Dublin, Ireland.

Quick Facts Address, Coordinates ...
History
The cinema had been operating since 1984, showing world cinema, and independent and Irish films. The Screen Cinema, originally named The New Metropole, opened on 16 March 1972 on the corner of Hawkins Street and Townsend Street on the site of the previous cinema, The Regal, which had been demolished since 1962 to make way for offices. The New Metropole name derived from the more famous Metropole Cinema on O'Connell Street (Penney's department store now occupies the building), and after the latter closed in 1973, the New Metropole became the Metropole.

Originally a single screen cinema, the auditorium was subdivided in 1982 to create two additional auditoria. The new screens were suspended from the ceiling, meaning the main screen was not reduced.

In 1984, it was renamed the Screen Cinema, which became the sister cinema to the more well known Savoy Cinema on O'Connell Street. After this, the Screen showed more unusual, independent, and foreign language films rather than mainstream Hollywood films, which attracted a cult audience to the cinema.

The Screen received a face-lift between 2004–2005 when the interior was upgraded and the cinema lost its original marquee and neon sign in favour of an electronic board displaying the programme.

Despite its unusual layout, the cinema has maintained a steady flow of cinema-goers, and thrives on art house films, usually keeping the most successful releases running until just before DVD release. The Screen has hosted the Jameson Dublin International Film Festival since its inception in 2002, and in 2007 alone, 48 films were screened over the six days the venue was in use. Celebrity festival visitors have included Wim Wenders, Julie Walters, John Boorman, and Eduardo Noriega.

In the summer of 2009, the Screen showed a season of classic films which included All About Eve, Casablanca, The Apartment, Brief Encounter, Guys and Dolls, and The Great Escape. Hallowe'en's """"Scream Cinema Monster Mash"""" offered audiences Ghost, Child's Play, The Shining, Evil Dead II, The Thing, Night of the Living Dead, and the surprise film, The Mist, in black and white.

The latest series of classics shown was the """"Ministry of Musicals"""" which featured the best Hollywood musicals and contemporary classics. The programme of films screened included Oklahoma!, Singin' in the Rain, An American in Paris, Meet Me in St. Louis, The Last Waltz, Labyrinth, This Is Spinal Tap, and Cry-Baby.

It was reported in February 2012 that the George's Quay Local Area Plan, prepared by Dublin City Council to regenerate Dublin's southeast inner city, indicated that the Screen Cinema could be demolished and later re-housed in replacement property development in the Hawkins Street area. In the same month, another report suggested that the cinema was in danger of closing altogether – in the previous decade, audience numbers fell from 200,000 to 60,000 per annum.

Closure
On the 19 February 2016, after 35 years in operation, it was announced in the media that the Screen Cinema would be closing its doors to the public as a result of falling ticket sales. It was hinted that Irish Multiplex Cinemas, parent company of Screen Cinema, were to close and sell the cinema a year earlier due to a drop in audience numbers. Staff working in Screen Cinema were said to be offered redundancy packages but this was later withdrawn by IMC and staff were instead offered to be transferred to the Savoy Cinema on O'Connell Street (another cinema in the IMC Group). It was said that all staff will be transferred to the Savoy Cinema with a redundancy package being available from the 29 February 2016.

Today, it is an almost finished Grade A Office Development that is due to open in early 2024. 

I saw 3 movies in the screen cinema in my lifetime. 2 were special showings of old movies, ( The Shining and Gremlins) while the other was a critically underrated and rarely seen movie staring John Cusack called MAX about Hitlers life as a Struggling Artist (if only he was admitted to Art college the world be so so different)",Dublin.

I’ve now spent two whole days in the city, and with the help of very nice locals but also very nice redditors (shout out to you guys) had a great time! 

I thought that maybe you guys would be interested in what a tourist thought of your city, so I’ll be documenting the places I’ve gone and will go.

Friday 12/8:
Arrived at Dublin airport 9:30 in the morning and took a bus to the temple bar. Went around the Liffey and ate at Beshoffs, where I had a pretty solid fish n chips. Went back to my hotel and later ate at Elephant and Castle, which was recommended by a local. And holy shit. The nachos starter is a thing send from heaven. So fucking good. Had some delicious salmon and mashed potato as well but nothing beat the starter.

Saturday:
Starting the day off visiting the Jeanie Johnston and emigration museum and oh boy, you guys set the standard high for museums. It was entertaining and interactive in the best kind of ways. Afterwards we went to the church bar and what a sight! The staff were awesome and the food and drinks delicious, sadly my family wanted to move on…
This is where we headed for the first place recommended by Reddit, The Cobblestones, but on the way there we almost tripped over the Jameson distillery where we luckily found a tour. You guys really are compassionate about your whiskey. The tour was very interesting and entertaining (and the free drinks didn’t make it worse). After a little tasting of whiskey we went to our destination of The Cobblestones and the atmosphere is amazing! The fantastic Irish music served with a pint of Guinness and the happy and cheerful crowd is something I’ll miss in Denmark. After a pint we went for some traditional food at James Connolly where we were served a brilliant beer and Guinness stew while watching the highlights of the United vs Bretford game.

Sunday:
Took a day trip to Howth looking at the wonderful scenery and walking along the cliffs from the summit to the village. We wandered around the harbor and met the cute seals. Then by recommendation we went to Abbey Tavern where we had the best meal of the trip, yet. The local sourced fish is a far higher standard than any in Denmark. Then we took the dart home and are now looking for a pub to drink some delicious and creamy Guinness.

 navigating the recent challenges in our city has got me thinking about the impact on housing, healthcare, and jobs. There's a noticeable presence of various communities, including Romanian, adding to the conversation.

Immigration in my opinion, hasn't worked for Dublin at all and hasn't been a net positive. Dublin has become too overcrowded.

If we did this the population of Dublin would significantly decrease and it would make sure that people who come into this country aren't going to commit crime. 

Secondly, we need to have harder vetting and reduce the number of asylum seekers. I don't mind asylum seekers, irish were once asylum seekers so I wouldn't deny that right. We just need harder vetting and less of them.

The result? This would result in more jobs for irish People in dublin, more housing and better access to an overcrowded healthcare system.

I walked over to them and said “is that your bike” and one of them approached me aggressively and said “get out of here do you want trouble” and I said “well I’m just wondering is that your bike” and he said “someone just robbed it an hour ago” and “the bastards locked it here”. 

Obviously after being aggressive towards me The whole story is bullshit. So I took out my phone and was Thinking should I phone the Gardaí or should I record them and, in the end, I just said the gardai wont be here fast enough and I don’t need the hassle of recording these pricks so I’m just going to go home. Either way they still would have taken then bike and legged it.

I've scheduled a viewing only to be turn up at the scheduled time and be told ***""""The tenants won't leave the place so I cant show you it""""*** I've responded to hundreds of posts within minutes, stating that I can come for a viewing that day or whenever they want only to be told ***""""im busy""""*** and then ignored or told later the place is now gone.

Ive dealt with about 5-10 scammers daily, the scams really vary in effort and sophistication there's the fairly high effort ones talking about refundable deposits for viewings that will definitely be returned, expressing the legality and normaility of asking for a deposit for a viewing in Ireland (I guess targeting foreign workers and students looking for a place) lots of information and fake images, landlords abroad who can only take payment x or y way.

Even an apparently deaf landlord who can only communicate through Whatsapp and Messenger and has to take payment through a sketchy app. Plenty around spewing their shite into every single group related to renting.

And on the other side of the spectrum theres the guy with realtor stock images on his profile who sent me google maps adresses in Mexico and the US, then finally sent me something in Cork and when I asked if the place can be viewed simply responds with ***""""no""""*** and blocked me hahaha. Some of the scammers are quite funny to be fair.

There must be a decent amount of people falling for them or I cant see them putting in so much tiime and commitment. 

Some of the conditions of renting a room are also hilarious, for rent but only Monday-Friday, not allowed to use the kitchen or renting to foreign students but refusing to let them use any of their cooking utensils, like they expect them to bring two suitcases of plates bowls and cutlery on the plane.

For example asking a bartender they tend to say no, but I think that’s because they don’t want to get in trouble with the law. Anyway, any and all info greatly appreciated.",16-10-2021 18:01,2021,

Mainland Europe is a very lonely place to live. Sure, people can be lonely anywhere but the chances of one being lonely in mainland EU is significantly higher because of reasons not related to your personality/likability etc. Yes EU is comprised of different countries with different languages and culture but few things which are common to a degree in most of them (I live in one of the EU country and have travelled to most of the places in EU and many times for extended period of time) is that people are cold, isolated, don't talk to strangers, lack humour/sarcasm (hit and miss but true in general), rude/lack politeness (especially in Eastern Europe, Germany/France/Italy/NL), very direct to a point of rudeness (but don't like when you are direct which is especially true for NL/DE), not easy going people and schedule an appointment to meet their friends/family etc., not helpful, lack empathy/emotion, you will always be an outsider even if you are born there and in general a very difficult society to integrate and feel at home.

If we consider the language barrier then the situation is even worse. Sure some places like NL, Scandinavia etc. have very high proportion of people who can speak english and so interacting with people to get help, dealing with bureaucracy etc. is much more easier than rest of Europe (due to very low number of people speaking English there) during your stay there but that's as far as it can go. While learning local language will solve understanding part but it still does not solve the core fact that mainland people for the most part are not easy to socialise with for above mentioned reasons. Moreover, learning a language is not easy even if the language is easier. Learning to speak and express EVERYTHING in a new language is not an easy task as one needs to learn from scratch what everything is called to grammar to local nuances etc. It takes years of practice and if you are working 9-6 everyday then that leaves one with hardly anytime to focus on language while also trying to build a social life and inspite of all this chances are very high that the core issues won't be solved. There are numerous posts on reddit where expats (even the ones who have invested years learning the local language) are highlighting above issues inspite of living for several years in EU countries. Some examples are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/jhw4n3/anyone_been_here_5_years_and_still_doesnt_feel/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/gatlzw/i_am_an_american_expat_in_the_netherlands_and_im/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/bq5ol1/making_friends_here_is_fucking_hard_i_feel/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/9w7nm5/i_became_a_worse_person_after_coming_to_germany/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/fj4w8r/is_it_actually_that_hard_making_friends_for/) out of many.

Sure, so many mainland western European countries rank very highly as most liveable countries/cities, best in class social welfare, one of the best infrastructure to the point of never needing car, lots of things to see and do etc. and rightfully so. I can attest to the fact that in those regard life is excellent but anything which concerns human interaction then it leaves a lot to be desired and the feeling of not feeling at home will keep building year on year. So, in those regards all those other positive factors can only go so far.

Now, I am living since several years as an expat myself in one of the western EU country and recently I picked up a role with an Irish company in Dublin and started working for them fulltime remotely and my experience has been nothing but amazing. The people are so kind, friendly, humorous, sociable and welcoming, a feeling I almost forgot how it feels after so many years of living here and its a very international workplace. If I want to I can move there as my company is interested me in having there. Ireland and British Isles in general are just so different people wise than all of the mainland EU countries.

But then I discovered the other side of Ireland. The fact that the real-estate market is completely broken, social welfare system is broken and skewed against working class, healthcare is broken, poor infrastructure and is car dependent outside few major city centres, lack of jobs, not much to do in cities except drinking in pubs and employment laws are bare minimum of whats in EU framework as below (point of comparison is western Europe on average):

1\] Employers are not obligated to pay for sick leaves (here it is kinda unlimited)

2\] Vacation days are 20 (as opposed to 25 or 30 in most of the places here)

3\] Pay 50 Eur to 100 Eur for doctors visit (no fees here).

4\] If one looses their job then the unemployment amount is fixed and not tied to previous salary (here it is 60% of previous salary for 1 year and after that rent/electricity will be covered along with many other government social welfare services at reduced cost)

5\] Pension payment is low and is not liveable (here it is liveable).

6\] Low maternity leaves as someone posted [here in /r/ireland](https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/m13r51/irelands_outdated_parental_leave_system/) (here it is 14 months but varies based on country)

7\] Conservative policies

8\] Very low tenants rights (here it is very high)

9\] Irish people themselves migrate in high numbers to other countries because of the local state of affairs.

I have spoken to my colleagues in my company from UK, Poland, Brazil etc. and all of them said all of the above are very big problems in Ireland but they only put up because Irish people are very nice and their short stays ended up being longterm.

So, this got me into thinking how can a highly educated, English speaking, western European wealthy country inhabited by smart and kind people endup with so many issues which are non existent in many other EU countries (including the UK which is most culturally similar to IE). Are people in Ireland not interested in getting these issues solved which makes them outliner in western EU.

An Irony is in most of western EU most of the things except people interaction are very nice and functioning whereas in Ireland most of the things except people interaction are not that great. While there is not much which can be done to change people but everything else can be changed especially when the country is small and population is low.

2) Husband’s work place is in the Business Park near the airport so which areas would be recommended to get a 2 or 3 bedroom house/apartment? 

3) Is advisable to live in the city centre?

4) Is it possible to get an unfurnished house/apartment here? 

5) Is it recommended to buy a car at the earliest after moving or we can depend on the public transport system?

Looking forward to some recommendations and views !!

Soon after the music round, around 10 pm, my Russian friend, Tanya and I, came outside for a smoke. We usually have a 10 min break after the music round. 

As we’re standing there, discussing the quiz, this well dressed man in a black tee shirt, a black blazer and blue jeans steps out of the pub and walks towards us. Tanya and I are both regulars and we’ve never seen him before.

It’s not burning anymore. “You’re in my space. Please step back. Actually, you know what. You’re giving me a really bad vibe. I’m going to move away from you.”

And she took a few steps away from the man.

“I agree with her,” I said to the man as soon as Tanya stepped aside. “You need to stay away.”

Tanya was quite shaken up. I lived in South Africa before moving to Ireland. So, I’m quite used to being racially attacked. 

Later, as the man was chased away by our lovely friends and bar staff at the Friary, we caught up with Erica, who was the first person to refuse to serve him.

“He said you refused to serve him coz you called him a ‘white cu*t’”, I explained. 

Erica stared at me and chuckled. “Is that what he said?”

“Apart from calling me black, yeah!” 

“Dave (our other wonderful bar person) told him, and I quote, ‘I’m not going to serve you because you’re QUITE DRUNK’!” Erica explained.

The man heard quite drunk as white cu*t!

Soon enough Erica went about narrating the story to almost everyone who was around.

“He didn’t hear wrong, though,” said John, one of our other regulars.

Oi gente! 

Meu nome é Gabriella, tenho 25 anos, sou brasileira, e estou lidando com uma grande frustração. Já faz um tempo que eu terminei a minha graduação  em Biologia (mais ou menos um ano). O problema é que eu não tenho o menor interesse em trabalhar nessa área, e descobri isso tarde demais pra desistir do curso. Consequentemente, estou desempregada e sem motivação alguma para continuar estudando ou fazendo qualquer coisa relacionada á minha área de formação. Sinceramente, o motivo principal pra eu ter terminado a faculdade foi pra orgulhar os meus pais, que se esforçaram muito pra que eu me formasse. 

Estou investindo em uma nova carreira, na área de línguas. Meu idioma nativo é o Português brasileiro e eu pretendo trabalhar com revisão de texto e tradução (Inglês/Português). Eu já comecei a fazer cursos online nessa área, e atualmente dou aulas de inglês para alunos de nível básico e intermediário como freelancer. Há mais ou menos um ano, faço aulas de inglês para ir do nível avançado para o fluente, e há alguns meses faço trabalho voluntário como transcritora de áudio para um podcast brasileiro (gostaria muito, inclusive, de fazer o mesmo em inglês!).

Estou aqui pra pegar dicas, conselhos, ideias, e também pra oferecer meu trabalho de transcrição, tradução (PT-BR/EN) e revisão de texto por um preço bem mais baixo que o que os profissionais da área costumam cobrar. Então, se você tem uma fanfic, um e-mail, um blog, vídeo do YouTube, ou qualquer tipo de texto para ser traduzido ou revisado, ou áudio para ser transcrito, entre em contato comigo! Farei com prazer.

I’m currently translating my brother’s fanfic (A Ordem Cerúlea – Available on NYAH! Fanfiction), and I’m going to share it with you guys soon!

Em português: 

Oi gente! 

Meu nome é Gabriella, tenho 25 anos, sou brasileira, e estou lidando com uma grande frustração. Já faz um tempo que eu terminei a minha graduação  em Biologia (mais ou menos um ano). O problema é que eu não tenho o menor interesse em trabalhar nessa área, e descobri isso tarde demais pra desistir do curso. Consequentemente, estou desempregada e sem motivação alguma para continuar estudando ou fazendo qualquer coisa relacionada á minha área de formação. Sinceramente, o motivo principal pra eu ter terminado a faculdade foi pra orgulhar os meus pais, que se esforçaram muito pra que eu me formasse. 

Estou investindo em uma nova carreira, na área de línguas. Meu idioma nativo é o Português brasileiro e eu pretendo trabalhar com revisão de texto e tradução (Inglês/Português). Eu já comecei a fazer cursos online nessa área, e atualmente dou aulas de inglês para alunos de nível básico e intermediário como freelancer. Há mais ou menos um ano, faço aulas de inglês para ir do nível avançado para o fluente, e há alguns meses faço trabalho voluntário como transcritora de áudio para um podcast brasileiro (gostaria muito, inclusive, de fazer o mesmo em inglês!).

Estou aqui pra pegar dicas, conselhos, ideias, e também pra oferecer meu trabalho de transcrição, tradução (PT-BR/EN) e revisão de texto por um preço bem mais baixo que o que os profissionais da área costumam cobrar. Então, se você tem uma fanfic, um e-mail, um blog, vídeo do YouTube, ou qualquer tipo de texto para ser traduzido ou revisado, ou áudio para ser transcrito, entre em contato comigo! Farei com prazer. 

No momento estou traduzindo a fanfic do meu irmão (A Ordem Cerúlea – Disponível em NYAH! Fanfiction), e pretendo divulgar os resultados em breve!

1250,Dublin,joshuaferris,80211,t3_182mc2z,"The first time I heard that anything was happening in Dublin was about 8   PM last night outside of Trinity College.   I live in Philadelphia, PA, USA, and am on vacation for the holiday weekend. Because of that fantastic """"vacation"""" status, I had the privilege of completely ignoring any and all news. 

I spent my day being a typical tourist, visiting Kilmainham Gaol and EPIC Museum and having tea at the Shelbourne. Last evening, I was on the well-reviewed Literary Pub Crawl tour.   I didn't know anything was happening when we started the tour upstairs at Duke's Pub.   There were 20 of us, and we left the pub to walk to Trinity College, where we were denied entrance.   People wondered what was happening, and our guide said, """"There are riots due to the stabbing.""""

Stabbing? What? The protective veneer of vacation ignorance was cracked, and our group walked to the end of Foster Pl at the Bank of Ireland to continue the tour. On our walk, I turned to my phone to figure out why I could not get into Trinity College, where I saw the first images of the riots in the Irish Times.

My worst quality, though not congenital and entirely developed by living in the United States, shone through. I thought, """"What's the big deal?"""" A stabbing, sure, it's tragic, but that's barely a news story in Philadelphia. Street-level violence in the United States is as omnipresent as overpriced beer in Temple Bar, so I didn't think much of it. 

Our guide finished his tour section focused on Wilde, leaving all the tourists smiling. How could you not? Pithy Wilde quotes can make the most cynical chuckle. Our guide commented about the gardaí overreacting, which put me at ease, and the vacation venere started to repair itself.

 We walked to O'Neills Bar and, upon arrival, were shocked to learn that the pub had closed.   Knowing the owner, our guide convinced him to let our group enter for 20 minutes for a drink. Would you believe it, but this was my first pint in Ireland.   I arrived the day before but didn't have the opportunity for a beer yet, so that Smithwick's Red Ale served like contraband was technically a vacation goal accomplished. It was here that someone in our group said, """"They are burning cars.""""   There was something wrong, but what else to do? Just press on.    Everyone in the group, North Americans, English, and one Aussie, carried themselves with invulnerability, so it seemed silly to fret and worry.

Our guide gave us 20 minutes in the bar, and he stuck to the schedule.    By 9 PM, he sent us back to the streets to give a speech on the steps of St. Andrew's Church.   He had his colleague play the guitar; we must have been quite a sight.   20 tourists listening to an old Irish ballad while many people hurried past us, clearly scurrying for some shelter.

When we finished this section of the Pub Crawl, the guide told us we would skip one of the pubs and end the night at Davy Byrnes.    We walked to the bar, where it was undoubtedly shut down.   The final speech and ballad happened in front of the Nespresso store.    He held to his original promise of having a quiz at the end, and as he asked us questions, which felt like force-feeding vacation fun at this point, 10-15 gardaí came down the street yelling for us to """"move on and get off the street!""""   The tour ended as they pushed us onto Grafton Street.

I was nervous, but I had my wits about me, and I thought everything was fine.    It was not until I realized the tour's balladeer was hurrying away quickly that I knew the situation was more precarious than I understood. More gardaí were walking south on Grafton and turned us in the opposite direction we needed to go.   Some other tourists from the group and I needed to return to the north side of the river. One woman asked the garda how we should get to our hotel and got the response, """"It's going to be a while.""""

We started to meander west, looking for a street to take us north. It soon became apparent that officials were more interested in protecting the Dior shop or any other high-end boutiques. I found myself with a pack of other East Coast Americans, where we all (I'll include myself) were complaining about the overreaction of the gardaí. I think all of us thought it was some kids burning trashcans.    I aimed for the Millennium Bridge, and the others were pushing east, so my husband and I broke away on Dame St.  I was very nervous they would start closing bridges. My #1 priority was getting to our hotel on the river's other side.

This is when I started to get scared.    I saw people throw trash bags from the sidewalk onto Dame Street.    It felt like the tension was increasing.   I hurriedly turned north on Fownes St, and that is when I noticed the men, no, boys, with covered faces.   A hole had been punched through the Urban Outfitters window, and graffiti said, """"Get out of here.""""

I turned to see my Arab husband taking a photo, grabbed his arm, and said, """"Don't stop moving.""""   That really felt like something anti-immigrant, but my mind crossed its fingers, hoping it was an anti-capitalist slogan.   Right? This was about preserving the popular real estate for local Irish businesses, right? If that's the case, we have nothing to worry about; I am a comrade, fuck Urban Outfitters. I knew those mental gymnastics were completely wrong, but it helped focus me at the moment.

We got to the river, and the Ha'penny Bridge was open, so we got on it as soon as possible.   There were more boys with covered faces.    The last gardaí I saw were protecting Grafton Street, and there was no official before and my hotel. Tensions eased once we were on the bridge.   One masked man even bumped into me and apologized, """"Sorry, mate.""""   

We got to our hotel, with shielded gardaí blocking Ormond Quay in the front.   The doors were locked, but once we got there, they let us in and informed us the bar was full and the kitchen was closed.   This left me to do little but fill myself with the news of what was happening.   That was when I found out there was a solid racist and anti-immigrant tone to these riots. It's where I learned that a train and a bus were destroyed, which was scarier and more chaotic than I realized.    

I got on Reddit and saw how sad and scared the Irish were, and it turned my stomach at how callus and desensitized every North American, including myself, had become to violence.   

I wrote this from the lobby of my hotel early Friday morning because I couldn't sleep. I suspect most of the staff are immigrants, and they are working so hard to make things feel okay, even though I heard one cleaner say how scared she was last night.

At the middle Abbey St stop more people got on and it was then packed. A guy and girl were last on and ended up being pressed against doors closing, it quickly became apparent that they were high, the girl was constantly spraying breath freshener in to her mouth, the guy (around 25) was slurring his speech saying he couldn’t move because of some « Chinese Bag » behind him, she was in fact a nice Asian girl but definitely not Chinese. He then took a lighter out and lit it to put against the Asian girl’s hair but his girlfriend stopped him. I want that Asian girl to know that I was watching her back and was ready to punch that scumbag until his girlfriend intervened. I had to get off at Jervis and wanted to tell the girl to move further into the carriage but was afraid to escalate things by being overheard so I just left but I  hope she got to her destination without any trouble.

At the middle Abbey St stop more people got on and it was then packed. A guy and girl were last on and ended up being pressed against doors closing, it quickly became apparent that they were high, the girl was constantly spraying breath freshener in to her mouth, the guy (around 25) was slurring his speech saying he couldn’t move because of some « Chinese Bag » behind him, she was in fact a nice Asian girl but definitely not Chinese. He then took a lighter out and lit it to put against the Asian girl’s hair but his girlfriend stopped him. I want that Asian girl to know that I was watching her back and was ready to punch that scumbag until his girlfriend intervened.

Is there any great shop in the South Dublin area that does something similar?  
I know there is a fancy whole foods shop in Greystones but looking for something a little bit more budget friendly?

Unfortunately, despite my best efforts I am unable to secure funding for the entire course term and I am falling short by a considerable margin that will leave me no option but to either defer or drop out. I had also applied for the GOI-IES (full tuition waiver + €10K stipend) in the hopes that if I do secure it, I could probably think about starting this fall. However, having read some of the visa rules I feel there might still be some caveats that will hinder me even if I get the scholarship. 

The visa application states that a partial payment of the tuition fees (€6K or 50% of the tuition fees, whichever is higher - in my case, €10K since the annual fee is €20K) need to be made upfront irrespective of any scholarship that one might secure. The problem is I will be able to front only €10-12K which could take care of either only the part-payment of the fees or the bank balance required to be shown for the visa application for my living expenses.

For those who know about this scholarship or have been recipients of it in the past or know people who have been awarded the scholarship, I have a few queries:

1. If awarded, would there be a possibility that I could apply for the visa without having to front the money for the tuition fees with just the letter of scholarship (since it is a direct scholarship from HEA and GOI)?
2. How long does it generally take for the university to be notified of the result and them furnishing you with the immigration letter?
3. How soon does the scholarship stipend generally get disbursed upon result? Result for GOI-IES 2022 is expected to be announced on June 1.

Also, I do intend to work part-time while I study to manage any other expenses I might incur during my time in Ireland.

I have just recently decided to move from my country to Ireland, not permanently, well, let me elaborate. 

I am from the United States, and for many maany reasons, it has become time, high time, to leave this place. Most of my reasons are personal, many are cultural, and some are political, but I wont put too much in about that, this is not a rant for my personal journey or ideals. But this is, me asking what I can expect for what I'm planning to do, and trying to navigate a different culture. 

I've skimmed this subreddit and r/ireland for others asking this very same thing, first off, ya'll seem so damn nice, I'm impressed by what I read, very helpful, kind, cool, informed, and accepting ( it makes me wonder if Irish people are generally like this... ) All very encouraging. My situation is a bit different from the other folks I saw asking on here. First I am an artist, and over here in the states, I've lived for the past 6 - 7 years in a very outsider kind of way, odd jobs ( just meaning less formal, usually no cv's or time schedules ), busking ( about 4 years ago now ), traveling around, living very close to the streets at times but the majority of my time  here was not always spent like this, I gravitate very closely to any alternative ways of living, difficult, not acceptable for most peoples lifestyles or comfort, but this is what I do. 

ENTERING IRELAND;

As of today, it looks like your country is allowing US citizens to enter, I was surprised, I don't know if this a good move on your governments part but look, I'm gonna take a chance and except the invitation, I won't ask questions. 

And it looks like being form the US I won't need a visa either, but I WILL have to self isolate for 14 days, which I will have to figure out how to do as you will be illuminated to in the rest of my situation below. If I can't find a way of doing this then the whole thing has to be called off, I'd like to comply, I'm not a virus conspiracy theorist, I want to comply. 

REGARDING WORKING;

I am looking for jobs online now, but I'm planning much more for going back to busking and living out of a tent and sleeping bag like before, at least to start off I'm not looking to try and hop right into looking for housing, more meeting people and making good solid connections. 

About this I'm wondering; How this is perceived and treated in your country? Over here, and in my state California,  vagrancy, from poverty, illness, choice of lifestyle etc etc is everywhere and visible, even a big big problem, even in my small town, and you can just do as you please really and the cops and other people won't do much, well the cops here in somewhat progressive California, as you may have seen, elsewhere this is, perhaps, not the case. What should I expect if I show up and live like this and play music for cash on the streets and sleep outside? Over here if you aren't driving around, you can easily make enough to feed yourself.  

I'll tell you my skills; painter ( I'll likely even bring some paintings with me to sell ), musician, ( play many instruments, produce, anything really  ), I'm also bilingual, can speak Spanish fluently and have a good grasp of Portuguese as my ability is now, I tell you these things just so you get the idea of what I could do or if you think of where I should go to apply these skills. I've done other side jobs of course but thats hardly important to list, just garbage, manual labor, generally ugliness. 

DUBLIN AREA; 

Of course, I'd like to be around any sort of art / culture part of the city if there is some sort of area like this there I'd probably just plant my self in the vicinity and try and meet folks. If you know where artist and the such congregate or work out of please let me know it would be a huge help in navigating the town. This can go for the rest of Ireland too if there is a good town I don't know about for this kind of atmosphere. 

Important cultural question: In skimming r/ireland and I believe this sub as well, I found some troubling posts about some problem Dublin has with white boys harassing people, and now targeting foreign workers. And I read about that poor man Thiago, and cried. 

So what is the deal with these kids, are they Nazis? Are you guys seeing the same infection I see happening over here? I ask mostly because I do happen to have dark skin, over here there are now murderous gangs of militia moving throughout the nation, looking to kill. I just want to know what the climate is like, from what I read it seems the dynamic is different and may not be like how it is here. I just want to know if this is some big problem I should know about, or if they are more like, losers, tweekers... 

Idk guys, too much reddit? 

OTHER STUFF;

Anything about the winter in Ireland, I'm from California, our cold is, not your cold, our winter is, not your winter, will I die of freezing? I'm wanting to leave anytime between, mid September to mid October. 

If I can enter Ireland and self quarantine, I plan to stay the three months allowed and see what happens for me, stay if things work out, or move on to the rest of western Europe, if the virus keeps being contained and you folks don't start to act like my fellow plague rats on this side of the Atlantic. 

I feel this is all I have to say right now. I put a great deal of information on here, thank you if you read all that, and I look forward to what ever responses I get, all help is hugely, hugely welcomed, and appreciated. 

Thank you.","Another: Moving to Ireland, Seeking Advice and Answers Poster.",1599373577,"Hello to everyone o/ 

I have just recently decided to move from my country to Ireland, not permanently, well, let me elaborate. 

I am from the United States, and for many maany reasons, it has become time, high time, to leave this place. Most of my reasons are personal, many are cultural, and some are political, but I wont put too much in about that, this is not a rant for my personal journey or ideals. But this is, me asking what I can expect for what I'm planning to do, and trying to navigate a different culture. 

I've skimmed this subreddit and r/ireland for others asking this very same thing, first off, ya'll seem so damn nice, I'm impressed by what I read, very helpful, kind, cool, informed, and accepting ( it makes me wonder if Irish people are generally like this... ) All very encouraging. My situation is a bit different from the other folks I saw asking on here. First I am an artist, and over here in the states, I've lived for the past 6 - 7 years in a very outsider kind of way, odd jobs ( just meaning less formal, usually no cv's or time schedules ), busking ( about 4 years ago now ), traveling around, living very close to the streets at times but the majority of my time  here was not always spent like this, I gravitate very closely to any alternative ways of living, difficult, not acceptable for most peoples lifestyles or comfort, but this is what I do.

Taking a girl on a 4th date tomorrow. I’m still new to Dublin, she’s Kildare. I’ve never done the whole Wicklow mountains thing or much scenery at all, or any of the beaches. I live on the edge of Phoenix park so it’s out the window, been loads.

Have did a good bit of research during the week, and the ones I could come up with were:
Powerscourt Gardens or Waterfall
Guinness Lake (Lough Tay)
Roundtree Indian Sculpture
Ticknock forest park
All of the pet farms

I know Glendalough is a bit further on down, but the walks there seem too long. Looking something under 45 mins- 1hr - neither of us want to be sweating/doing steep climbs if we’re gonna be going for drinks later in the evening. We’ve both a good fitness level but you get what I mean!

Had to rule out Bray-Greystones cliff walk because it’s 7km? A shame as I’ve heard it’s beautiful! 

Maybe I’ll hike on a separate occasion if your recommendations fall into the 1hr+ category!

Somewhere different to eat tomorrow evening in these areas would be good too.

1425,Tipperary,hiliikkkusss,105490,t3_uji0qb," Tipperary Park’s name dates back to when the city works yard and firehall were located on the central square, where city hall is situated today. In 1889, the city began hiring many men to work on street construction, and soon the works yard located here became a squatter’s camp for these labourers and some families. The Daily Columbian reported: “Westminster’s Tipperary, the Government Reserve above Royal Avenue, is nearly evacuated, a couple of families only remaining on the ground. It is pretty generally known that a number of people, mostly single men, employed on the street improvements camped out on the reserve last summer, but the wet weather has driven most of them to seek more comfortable quarters. A few, however, remain, and will weather the winter under canvas. The residents in the vicinity of the reserve named the camp ‘New Tipperary’ from the fact that a few immigrants from the ‘ould dart’ were among its inhabitants. Like its contemporary in Ireland, our New Tipperary promises a short lived existence.” The squatters evacuated the site in 1892 after an order by the province, but they left the colloquial name Tipperary behind as their legacy. County Tipperary in Ireland takes its ancient name from the old Irish language “Tiobraid Árann” which means “House of the well of Ara.” The county was created and named after the town in 1328, making it one of the earliest of the Irish counties.","Hello from Canada, Theres a park in my part of country Called Tipperary Park",1651822081," Tipperary Park’s name dates back to when the city works yard and firehall were located on the central square, where city hall is situated today.

It is pretty generally known that a number of people, mostly single men, employed on the street improvements camped out on the reserve last summer, but the wet weather has driven most of them to seek more comfortable quarters. A few, however, remain, and will weather the winter under canvas. The residents in the vicinity of the reserve named the camp ‘New Tipperary’ from the fact that a few immigrants from the ‘ould dart’ were among its inhabitants. Like its contemporary in Ireland, our New Tipperary promises a short lived existence.” The squatters evacuated the site in 1892 after an order by the province, but they left the colloquial name Tipperary behind as their legacy. County Tipperary in Ireland takes its ancient name from the old Irish language “Tiobraid Árann” which means “House of the well of Ara.” The county was created and named after the town in 1328, making it one of the earliest of the Irish counties.",06-05-2022 07:28,2022,No

1455,Dublin,Psmpo,36000,t3_53ouy4,"Hi Dubliners,

First of all, thank you in advance for any help you can lend.

I have a 9 hr layover in Dublin this Thurs (22/9) and want to use the time I have to explore the city, since I have never spent time in Ireland. I arrive in the morning and leave in the late afternoon (hopping over to Manchester, so I don't think I have to be back at the airport many hours in advance, as with traditional international). Overall, I'll probably have 7 hours to actually wander around town.

A little about me: I'm an English expat living in the US, so I'm familiar with most social norms and hopefully won't come off as a completely stereotypical tourist, but I do know so little about Dublin that I will still be a bit out of place. I don't drink, so unless a group of redditors wants to chat with me at one, pubs aren't on the top of my list. I prefer to travel on public transport or on foot, rather than taking a taxi. And I'm female and under 30, in case that affects your recommendations.

Specific things I'm looking for:

- Info on the best way to travel from the airport to the interesting parts of town (preferably public transport) and then back again

- A few things and places that might be interesting to see or visit (not necessarily tourist spots)

- A restaurant that serves vegan food (if easier: Indian, Thai, Lebanese)

- Information on specific bus routes that I can use to get to various places and some info on how the busses operate (e.g. how often do they come by, how much cash do I need, are they usually on schedule, is there a cheaper day pass option?)

- If you are feeling ambitious, maybe an order of places/things so that I can maximize my time doing things (maybe looping around the city) rather than traveling...enough places to keep me occupied, but not so many that it's unrealistic

- Maybe a kind redditor to eat lunch with me? I'm very nice but would want the conversation to focus on life in Dublin/Ireland, so it's definitely not an opportunity to try to pull an unsuspecting tourist

- Any other tips that might help me make the most of my time in the city

1465,Dublin,Cogitoergosum1981,82274,t3_19crzev,"DUBLINTIMEMACHINE: The  Drumcondra Ambush in 1921 was a daring, desperate battle during the War of Independence. This is a story of youth, courage, betrayal, and tragedy. 

1.

A modest plaque on an unassuming bridge commemorates the catastrophic engagement. It also memorialised some of the """"Forgotten Ten"""", the name was given to executed patriots who were buried in unmarked graves.  

""""Frank Flood Bridge"""" was built in 1818. The handsome three-arch span structure is named after Frank Flood, a 19 year old engineering student who had attended O’Connell’s CBS, then earned a scholarship to UCD. He was a good mate of Kevin Barry. Both lads were in H Company of the Dublin Brigade of the IRA. Barry had been executed by the British only months before the Drumcondra operation.

2.

Flood lead an Active Service Unit of eight young people in the 1st Dublin Brigade of the IRA, called Section One. Section One consisted of Frank Flood,  Bernard ‘Bertie’ Ryan (21) Thomas Bryan (24) and Patrick Doyle (29) Michael ‘Mick’ Magee (24) Burke and Dunne, and Dermot O’Sullivan (17) 

3.

On 21st January 1921, during the War of Independence, Flood's unit set out to ambush a Royal Irish Constabulary lorry at Binn's Bridge, Drumcondra. Section One was armed with revolvers and hand grenades. The RIC lorries patrol route ran from the Brit's base at Gormanstown over Binn's bridge. 

It's important to consider the tactical significance of Drumcondra at the time. Supply and patrol routes from British garrisons at Collinstown and Gormanstown are predictably funneled through Drumcondra. The parish was then at the northern edge of the growing city. It had an almost rural character, surrounded by fields and market gardens. The town's main road, and multiple bridges crossing the Tolka and Royal Canal in Drumcondra, were ideal ambush points.

4.

The strategy was simple. Section One would lay in wait, permit the lorry to drive into their trap and then all units would attack with guns and grenades. The men assumed their concealed positions at 8.30 am. They split up into four groups of two. One took the corner of Belvedere Road, and another set up on the corner of North Circular Road. Another at Leeches’s pub and Fitzroy Avenue. The final two waited on the far side of the bridge. The lads were poised. Guns concealed but ready, muscles tense, beads of sweat stinging their eyes.

But the expected time came and went with no sign of their quarry. It was now 9.30 am and Drumcondra was waking up. Pedestrians and cars were on the streets. Civilians and children going to work and school. Commander Flood had to think on his feet to salvage the mission. He called for a withdrawal down toward a quieter new position past Tolka Bridge, opposite St Patrick’s National School, now Clonturk Park.

5.

In to this high-tension scenario enters Sergeant Singleton of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Some of Section One suggested he be taken as hostage, but members of the DMP were explicitly not targets in this operation. Singleton was allowed to pass unmolested but he later informed the Tan's of the position and make-up of the IRA volunteers.  

Though the lads were hiding in urban Dublin, the stakes of discovery were high enough to make them imagine themselves soldiers crouched in the trenches of Flanders. They waited, nerves trembling with adrenaline. Eventually, Flood decided to call off the operation to fight another day. They assembled at the top of Richmond Road. Suddenly a British Army van appeared from the Whitehall direction. Maybe this mission might not be a failure after all!

6.

As they relocated the target lorry sped past them, catching the men on foot and exposed. They had already committed to this new ambush. Two IRA Volunteers were now at the corner of Richmond Road, and the rest of Floods team were concealed behind the stone wall at Clonturk Park.

Once the vehicle was within range they threw a grenade into it. As the small explosion incapacitated the van, a Black and Tan armoured car and a small convoy of military lorries approached at speed from the city centre direction. As Section One began to respond yet another armoured vehicle appeared from the Whitehall direction. This was clearly no coincidence. The tables had turned and now they were in a trap, ambushed in a crossfire, and badly outnumbered!

7. 

The IRA had been betrayed. The Black and Tans (British auxiliaries) had been tipped off by Dublin Metropolitan Police Sergeant Singleton. Unconfirmed rumours also alleged a civilian called Robert Pike, who lived in the local Tolka Cottages, approached the Tan's as they passed his home and gave them vital information on troop numbers and location.

The lorries full of RIC constables pulled up on Section One, armed and ready for the gunfight. The British spilled out and the air rang with gunfire and the juxtaposition of Irish and RIC voices barking commands and curses. Hot lead from rifles peppering vehicles and stone. As the lorry drew the men's attention, they drove out of range making way for the Black and Tans motorcade. These trucks and the armoured car rolled in and cut off Section One's escape route. 

Flood's remaining five men frantically retreated on foot down Richmond Road toward Ballybough. At the junction of Gracepark Road, the Tans were nearly upon them. Their only hope was to try and disappear into the rural area of Clonturk Park. Hearts pounding nearly out of their chests, the Tan's roars in their ears, they fled exposed across open ground. Suddenly the terrifying thunder of a Lewis automatic machine gun tore across the field among them. 

8.

Michael ‘Mick’ Magee, from Arbour Hill, and Seán Burke pushed their exhausted bodies to the limit to escape. They ran through a field of allotments opposite St. Patrick College in nearby Clonturk Park. The Black and Tan's Lewis machine gun spat fatal fire at the desperate men.

Magee felt the hot lead bite into his leg and side. Wounded he fell into the dirt. His comrade Burke tried to lift him but the Tan's shot Magee again. He pleaded with Burke to keep running. Imagine Burke's agony of having to abandon him, carrying on, your friend's blood on your hands. Knowing you might very well be next to fall. The badly injured Magee was taken by the British to King George V Military Hospital (now St Bricin’s) He succumbed to his wounds the next morning. 

9.

Their dying comrade behind them, the savage fury of machine-gun fire filling their ears the Section split. Flood with four others (Doyle, Bryan, Ryan, and O’Sullivan) reached Gracepark Gardens. In desperate survival mode, they sprint towards a house. Hand shaking, Flood points his revolver to try and blow the lock off the front door. There was an """"asylum"""" for the Blind behind the little housing estate. The lads hoped to escape through the residence, out the backyard, and over the wall into the extensive campus grounds. 

But shooting the door doesn't work. Instead, the hoarse English-accented voices of the Tan's surround them. Their commander demands immediate surrender, others plead with their leader to let them shoot the murdering Fenian bastards. Defeated and hopeless and under a barrage of rifle butts and batons the five IRA Volunteers are bound and taken into custody at the stockade of the North Dublin Union.

10.

The men of Section One were charged with high treason, by levying war against the King. Their sentence was death. Two months later, in the grim loathsome executed yard in Mountjoy Prison, the four young men mounted the platform beneath the gallows.
Compare for a moment these boys of Section One with their contemporaries today. 

How different are their dreams and their destinies? What would these young men be thinking? How would their sweethearts, mates, and parents feel imagining the sound of that drop through the trapdoor, that snap of the noose? There is the distant sound of thousands roaring beyond those inescapable stone walls and iron gates. As their short lives flash before their eyes, the hangman pulls down the sackcloth hood upon their faces. The sound of their pulse pumping in their ears is like an ocean rushing. At an unseen signal, the four were hung. Flood's younger brother Patrick was present at his execution. 

The 4 executed Volunteers were members of the so-called """"Forgotten Ten’. These were Patriots who had been executed in Mountjoy Prison by the British occupational forces during the Irish War of Independence. These """"court marshaled"""" IRA soldiers were buried in unmarked graves in 1920–21.

Dermot O’Sullivan (17) had also been sentenced to execution, this was commuted to life in prison due to him being a minor. He was released from Portland Gaol in August 1921. Two other volunteers, Burke and Dunne, escaped. Burke, through an act of compassion, with a little luck found safety in a friendly local house. When the Tan's performed their door-to-door search, the family and servant girl helped disguise him as a resident.  

11. 

None of the Black and Tans or RIC officers was injured during the failed IRA ambush. The Section One survivors; Mick Dunne, Seán Burke, Christopher """"Kit"""" O’Malley, and Dermot O’Sullivan all joined the Irish National Army in January 1922. 

In the short term, the ambush and hangings were a disaster for the IRA and the War of Independence. But, in a repeat of the effects of the Rising, the executions created huge sympathy for the Cause and stoked anti-British passions across the country and abroad. As the young men hung from the gallows of Mountjoy worker's unions throughout Dublin downed tools in solidarity and crowds gathered outside the jail in prayer and protest.

Dunne would be killed by a booby-trap mine explosion in Kerry in March 1923. Burke left the Army and emigrated to America. O’Sullivan and O’Malley survived the War of Independence and the Civil War and lived full lives. O’Malley even acted as a military adviser in a propaganda film called Irish Destiny in 1926.

12.

Sergeant Singleton, whose life had been spared, fled to Scotland when it became apparent through intel that he had betrayed the unit and was no longer safe in Dublin. 

Following rumours that a local man had informed the Black and Tan's about the Volunteers, on the 21st of June 1921, the IRA executed Robert Pike near his home at Tolka Bridge. His widow and kids remained living in the area. His eldest son Robert Pike Jr. joined the British Army during WWII and fought at Dunkirk.

Finally, on the 4th of October 2001, The Forgotten Ten received their well-deserved state funerals. Their cortège was lined by an honour guard of thousands of citizens. 9 of the 10 were reinterred in Glasnevin Cemetry and the other in Limerick.",The Drumcondra Ambush,1705916373,"DUBLINTIMEMACHINE: The  Drumcondra Ambush in 1921 was a daring, desperate battle during the War of Independence.

thanks very much for this, as I am a bit lost here, though I totally agree with the welcoming of the refugees. I'd like the same generosity here in france.

I am  30 years old, single, no kids. I am from Brazil and I lived in the Amazon region in a small state. I am currently living in Limerick. I am an easygoing person, a bit shy depending on the situation. I like to go for a walk in the park and play basketball. In my free time I also watch series on Netflix, I read books, I chat with some friends, etc. I am very passionate about the place where I lived in and its history. 

I like to tell stories and share my point of view about my city and Brazil in general (ranging from politics to religion) in a politely and open way, always listening to other opinions. I am a listener as well. I am curious and getting to know people from all over the world is a chance of expanding my mind and life through other people experiences. Even within my own city (or village, community, state) it is hard to cover how huge it is when one takes in account indigenous people personal lives and their stories, plus the diversity of the Amazon and all the stories it carries. I am trying to become vegan (I heven't succeded yet) and have a better lifestyle these days. Speaking of family, I am a family person. I don't care about distance. I think that when someone really wants something to happen, it happens, yo know? I believe that when a couple have similar goals, it stregthens the relationship.

Was coming back from city center towards on one of the C night buses. Was sitting on the top floor in the seats near the stairs. There was a young  couple behind me and a man with gym gear on in front. . Trip goes fine  and everyone is minding their own business until a bunch if teenagers (idk their exact age, I'd say 14'-16yo) showed up and started causing a mess and being loud etc.

The people I mentioned  are all p.o.c (man in the front was black and the couple was south asian). Those kids basically surrounded the couple and started  harassing them and   were trying his best to provoke the man by asking if the woman was his GF, threatening him to answer their questions and not to react other wise they'd get jumped by the whole group of teens.

.  The man of the couple  was furious for obvious reasons and then they just started making v stereotypical accents to mock them. He stayed collected and  I managed to calm him down by communicating with eye contact that it wasn't worth it but I 100% understand the anger.

The bus drivers did use the microphone to tell them to sit the f down but to no avail.

Part of the kids moved to the front past me to annoy the man in front of me  and kinda tried a similar thing where they would jut be inappropriate and try to get any kind of reaction from him as an excuse to pick a fight.

At that point it was my stop  I decided to leave the bus. Made eye contact with the couple one last time and the woman was on the edge of tears but nodded to say goodbye.

Mentioned the situation to the driver and then left. The bus  I have no idea of what transpired afterwards.

Is this kind of incident frequent on night buses in this city?

1564,Dublin,[deleted],35408,t3_1c5962,"Hello :)

24 year old gal from NYC, going to Dublin for 5 days (and 3 days in London) with my boyfriend, in just a few weeks.  This is our first time traveling to Europe (and most anywhere in the world for that matter - we've just never had the time/money to actually travel, but decided a few months ago to splurge and go to these two places).

Really excited to go because most of my family is originally from Ireland , and it's a place I've always wanted to see.  

Plans thus far are to stay at a B&B near central Dublin, and to spend one day traveling through Limerick to the Cliffs on the west coast.  May also spend an afternoon taking the train to some of the small fishing towns off the coast of dublin.  We've gotten some suggestions but otherwise don't really have many things locked in to see once we are there.

We are on a bit of a budget (not *too* much of a budget though, between the two of us we should have around $950.00 USD saved for the 9-10 days of traveling we will be doing)...I know that with it being converted to the Euro that number will hold less value, but we are used to squeezing our budgets so it shouldn't be a huge deal.

So any suggestions on places to go, see , eat, etc would be great!  Much more attracted to having traditional Irish food and drink; we live in NYC (queens) already and eat chinese/mexican/indian food too much as it is ;)   ...we are open to both a mix of tourist and non-tourist suggestions...also would like a heads up on some of the customs there; like I said we haven't traveled much (well I suppose I should only speak for myself - my boyfriend grew up in Morocco until he was 12, so he is more familiar with being abroad...I on the other hand have only traveled as far as New Orleans in the past 3-4 years, so I'm definitely leaving my comfort zone =] ).

I (dual American and Irish Citizen) may receive a job offer in Dublin. The salary is probably no higher than 50k Euro a year. We would be moving from Russia. 

I have a lot of questions about living in or outside of (most likely option, with the low salary) the city with my family (wife, stepchild, dog, all Russian nationals). Once we get them immigration visas, I wonder how we will be able find our footing with housing, school, transport, and any other benefits/assistance we may receive.

Our other option is to move to the US with a similar salary in a big, expensive city similar to Dublin. 

We are happy to have these options but are trying to figure out what will be best. I have already lived in the US city in question, have friends and family there, and would be working with the company I’m currently at. That said, my family will be very far away from their loved ones in Russia and the US is tearing itself apart politically at the moment, not to mention the ongoing poor relations between Russia and the US. In Dublin, though, we have no connections aside from a few distant relatives I’ve never met and no knowledge of how life is there. We visited for two days a few years ago, but that’s the extent of our experience. Despite these facts, we tend to believe the future in Ireland might be better for our daughter as she will get (eventually) EU citizenship, be able to study in uni for free, and be closer to her natural father and grandparents in Russia. Also, flights back to Russia for us to visit will be much cheaper. 

I’m wondering if any locals have advice or thoughts about the feasibility of moving to the Dublin area on a relatively low salary without any support system in place. Thank you so much!",Moving to Dublin from Russia,1645617483,"Hello everyone!
